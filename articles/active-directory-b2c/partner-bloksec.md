In this sample tutorial, learn how to integrate Azure Active Directory (AD) B2C authentication with [BlokSec](https://bloksec.com/). BlokSec simplifies the end-user login experience by providing customers passwordless authentication and tokenless multifactor authentication (MFA). BlokSec protects customers against identity-centric cyber-attacks such as password stuffing, phishing, and man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Scenario description

BlokSec integration includes the following components:

- **Azure AD B2C** – Configured as the authorization server/identity provider for any B2C application.

- **BlokSec Decentralized Identity Router** – Acts as a gateway for services that wish to apply BlokSec’s DIaaS™ to route authentication and authorization requests to end users’ Personal Identity Provider (PIdP) applications; configured as an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider in Azure AD B2C.

- **BlokSec SDK-based mobile app** – Acts as the users’ PIdP in the decentralized authentication scenario. The freely downloadable [BlokSec yuID](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bloksec) application can be used if your organization prefers not to develop your own mobile applications using the BlokSec SDKs.
The following architecture diagram shows the implementation.

![image shows the architecture diagram](./media/partner-bloksec/partner-bloksec-architecture-diagram.png)

|Steps| Description|
|:---------------|:----------------|
|1.| User attempts to log in to an Azure AD B2C application and is forwarded to Azure AD B2C’s combined sign-in and sign-up policy.|
|2.| Azure AD B2C redirects the user to the BlokSec decentralized identity router using the OIDC authorization code flow.|
|3.| The BlokSec decentralized router sends a push notification to the user’s mobile app including all context details of the authentication and authorization request.|
|4.| The user reviews the authentication challenge, if accepted the user is prompted for biometry such as fingerprint or facial scan as available on their device, proving the user’s identity.|
|5.| The response is digitally signed with the user’s unique digital key. Final authentication response provides proof of possession, presence, and consent. The respond is returned to the BlokSec decentralized identity router.|
|6.| The BlokSec decentralized identity router verifies the digital signature against the user’s immutable unique public key that is stored in a distributed ledger, then replies to Azure AD B2C with the authentication result.|
|7.| Based on the authentication result user is granted/denied access.|

## Onboard to BlokSec

Request a demo tenant with BlokSec by filling out [the form](https://bloksec.com/). In the message field indicates that you would like to onboard with Azure AD B2C.

::: zone pivot="b2c-custom-policy"

>[!NOTE]
>In Azure Active Directory B2C, [**custom policies**](./user-flow-overview.md) are designed primarily to address complex scenarios. For most scenarios, we recommend that you use built-in [**user flows**](./user-flow-overview.md).

### Part 2 - Create a policy key

Store the client secret that you previously recorded in your Azure AD B2C tenant.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. Make sure you're using the directory that contains your Azure AD B2C tenant. Select the **Directories + subscriptions** icon in the portal toolbar.
1. On the **Portal settings | Directories + subscriptions** page, find your Azure AD B2C directory in the **Directory name** list, and then select **Switch**.
1. Choose **All services** in the top-left corner of the Azure portal, and then search for and select **Azure AD B2C**.
1. On the Overview page, select **Identity Experience Framework**.
1. Select **Policy Keys** and then select **Add**.
1. For **Options**, choose `Manual`.
1. Enter a **Name** for the policy key. For example, `BlokSecAppSecret`. The prefix `B2C_1A_` is added automatically to the name of your key.
1. In **Secret**, enter your client secret that you previously recorded.
1. For **Key usage**, select `Signature`.
1. Select **Create**.

### Part 3 - Configure BlokSec as an Identity provider

To enable users to sign in using BlokSec decentralized identity, you need to define BlokSec as a claims provider that Azure AD B2C can communicate with through an endpoint. The endpoint provides a set of claims that are used by Azure AD B2C to verify a specific user has authenticated using biometry such as fingerprint or facial scan as available on their device, proving the user’s identity.

You can define BlokSec as a claims provider by adding it to the **ClaimsProvider** element in the extension file of your policy

1. Open the `TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml`.

2. Find the **ClaimsProviders** element. If it dosen't exist, add it under the root element.

3. Add a new **ClaimsProvider** as follows:

    ```xml
    <ClaimsProvider>
      <Domain>bloksec</Domain>
      <DisplayName>BlokSec</DisplayName>
      <TechnicalProfiles>
        <TechnicalProfile Id="BlokSec-OpenIdConnect">
          <DisplayName>BlokSec</DisplayName>
          <Description>Login with your BlokSec decentriled identity</Description>
          <Protocol Name="OpenIdConnect" />
          <Metadata>
            <Item Key="METADATA">https://api.bloksec.io/oidc/.well-known/openid-configuration</Item>
            <!-- Update the Client ID below to the BlokSec Application ID -->
            <Item Key="client_id">00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000</Item>
            <Item Key="response_types">code</Item>
            <Item Key="scope">openid profile email</Item>
            <Item Key="response_mode">form_post</Item>
            <Item Key="HttpBinding">POST</Item>
            <Item Key="UsePolicyInRedirectUri">false</Item>
            <Item Key="DiscoverMetadataByTokenIssuer">true</Item>
            <Item Key="ValidTokenIssuerPrefixes">https://api.bloksec.io/oidc</Item>
          </Metadata>
          <CryptographicKeys>
            <Key Id="client_secret" StorageReferenceId="B2C_1A_BlokSecAppSecret" />
          </CryptographicKeys>
          <OutputClaims>
            <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="issuerUserId" PartnerClaimType="sub" />
            <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="displayName" PartnerClaimType="name" />
            <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="givenName" PartnerClaimType="given_name" />
            <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="surName" PartnerClaimType="family_name" />
            <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="email" PartnerClaimType="email" />
            <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="authenticationSource" DefaultValue="socialIdpAuthentication" AlwaysUseDefaultValue="true" />
            <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="identityProvider" PartnerClaimType="iss" />
          </OutputClaims>
          <OutputClaimsTransformations>
            <OutputClaimsTransformation ReferenceId="CreateRandomUPNUserName" />
            <OutputClaimsTransformation ReferenceId="CreateUserPrincipalName" />
            <OutputClaimsTransformation ReferenceId="CreateAlternativeSecurityId" />
            <OutputClaimsTransformation ReferenceId="CreateSubjectClaimFromAlternativeSecurityId" />
          </OutputClaimsTransformations>
          <UseTechnicalProfileForSessionManagement ReferenceId="SM-SocialLogin" />
        </TechnicalProfile>
      </TechnicalProfiles>
    </ClaimsProvider>
    ```

4. Set **client_id** to the application ID from the application registration.

5. Save the file.

### Part 4 - Add a user journey

At this point, the identity provider has been set up, but it's not yet available in any of the sign-in pages. If you don't have your own custom user journey, create a duplicate of an existing template user journey, otherwise continue to the next step.  

1. Open the `TrustFrameworkBase.xml` file from the starter pack.

2. Find and copy the entire contents of the **UserJourneys** element that includes ID=`SignUpOrSignIn`.

3. Open the `TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml` and find the **UserJourneys** element. If the element doesn't exist, add one.

4. Paste the entire content of the **UserJourney** element that you copied as a child of the **UserJourneys** element.

5. Rename the ID of the user journey. For example,  ID=`CustomSignUpSignIn`.  

### Part 5 - Add the identity provider to a user journey

Now that you have a user journey, add the new identity provider to the user journey. First add a sign-in button, then link the button to an action. The action is the technical profile you created earlier.  

1. Find the orchestration step element that includes Type=`CombinedSignInAndSignUp`, or Type=`ClaimsProviderSelection` in the user journey. It's usually the first orchestration step. The **ClaimsProviderSelections** element contains a list of identity providers that a user can sign in with. The order of the elements controls the order of the sign-in buttons presented to the user. Add a **ClaimsProviderSelection** XML element. Set the value of **TargetClaimsExchangeId** to a friendly name.

2. In the next orchestration step, add a **ClaimsExchange** element. Set the **Id** to the value of the target claims exchange ID. Update the value of **TechnicalProfileReferenceId** to the ID of the technical profile you created earlier.

The following XML demonstrates the first two orchestration steps of a user journey with the identity provider:

```xml
<OrchestrationStep Order="1" Type="CombinedSignInAndSignUp" ContentDefinitionReferenceId="api.signuporsignin">
  <ClaimsProviderSelections>
    ...
    <ClaimsProviderSelection TargetClaimsExchangeId="BlokSecExchange" />
  </ClaimsProviderSelections>
  ...
</OrchestrationStep>

<OrchestrationStep Order="2" Type="ClaimsExchange">
  ...
  <ClaimsExchanges>
    <ClaimsExchange Id="BlokSecExchange" TechnicalProfileReferenceId="BlokSec-OpenIdConnect" />
  </ClaimsExchanges>
</OrchestrationStep>
```

### Part 6 - Configure the relying party policy

The relying party policy, for example [SignUpSignIn.xml](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-b2c-custom-policy-starterpack/blob/master/SocialAndLocalAccounts/SignUpOrSignin.xml), specifies the user journey which Azure AD B2C will execute. Find the **DefaultUserJourney** element within relying party. Update the **ReferenceId** to match the user journey ID, in which you added the identity provider.

In the following example, for the `CustomSignUpOrSignIn` user journey, the ReferenceId is set to `CustomSignUpOrSignIn`.

```xml
<RelyingParty>
  <DefaultUserJourney ReferenceId="CustomSignUpSignIn" />
  ...
</RelyingParty>
```

### Part 7 - Upload the custom policy

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home).
1. Make sure you're using the directory that contains your Azure AD B2C tenant. Select the **Directories + subscriptions** icon in the portal toolbar.
1. On the **Portal settings | Directories + subscriptions** page, find your Azure AD B2C directory in the **Directory name** list, and then select **Switch**.
1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home), search for and select **Azure AD B2C**.
1. Under Policies, select **Identity Experience Framework**.
Select **Upload Custom Policy**, and then upload the two policy files that you changed, in the following order: the extension policy, for example `TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml`, then the relying party policy, such as `SignUpSignIn.xml`.

### Part 8 - Test your custom policy

1. Select your relying party policy, for example `B2C_1A_signup_signin`.
1. For **Application**, select a web application that you [previously registered](./tutorial-register-applications.md). The **Reply URL** should show `https://jwt.ms`.
1. Select the **Run now** button.
1. From the sign-up or sign-in page, select **Google** to sign in with Google account.

If the sign-in process is successful, your browser is redirected to `https://jwt.ms`, which displays the contents of the token returned by Azure AD B2C.

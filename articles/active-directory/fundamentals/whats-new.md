## October 2021
 
### Limits on the number of configured API permissions for an application registration will be enforced starting in October 2021

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Other  
**Product capability:** Developer Experience
 
Sometimes, application developers configure their apps to require more permissions than it's possible to grant. To prevent this from happening, a limit on the total number of required permissions that can be configured for an app registration will be enforced.

The total number of required permissions for any single application registration mustn't exceed 400 permissions, across all APIs. The change to enforce this limit will begin rolling out mid-October 2021. Applications exceeding the limit can't increase the number of permissions they are configured for. The existing limit on the number of distinct APIs for which permissions are required remains unchanged and may not exceed 50 APIs.

In the Azure portal, the required permissions are listed under API permissions for the application you wish to configure. Using Microsoft Graph or Microsoft Graph PowerShell, the required permissions are listed in the requiredResourceAccess property of an [application](/graph/api/resources/application?view=graph-rest-1.0) entity. [Learn more](../enterprise-users/directory-service-limits-restrictions.md).

### Email one-time passcode on by default change beginning rollout in November 2021

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** B2B  
**Product capability:** B2B/B2C
 
Previously, we announced that starting October 31, 2021, Microsoft Azure Active Directory [email one-time passcode](../external-identities/one-time-passcode.md) authentication will become the default method for inviting accounts and tenants for B2B collaboration scenarios. However, because of deployment schedules, we'll begin rolling out on November 1, 2021. Most of the tenants will see the change rolled out in January 2022 to minimize disruptions during the holidays and deployment lock downs. After this change, Microsoft will no longer allow redemption of invitations using Azure Active Directory accounts that are unmanaged. [Learn more](../external-identities/one-time-passcode.md#frequently-asked-questions).

### Conditional Access Guest Access Blocking Screen

**Type:** Fixed  
**Service category:** Conditional Access  
**Product capability:** End User Experiences
 
If there's no trust relation between a home and resource tenant, a guest user would have previously been asked to re-register their device, which would break the previous registration. However, the user would end up in a registration loop because only home tenant device registration is supported. In this specific scenario, instead of this loop, we have created a new conditional access blocking page. The page tells the end user that they can't get access to conditional access protected resources as a guest user. [Learn more](../external-identities/b2b-quickstart-add-guest-users-portal.md#prerequisites).

### 50105 Errors will now result in a UX error message instead of an error response to the application

**Type:** Fixed  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** Developer Experience
 
Azure AD has fixed a bug in an error response that occurs when a user isn't assigned to an app that requires a user assignment. Previously, Azure AD would return error 50105 with the OIDC error code "interaction_required" even during interactive authentication. This would cause well-coded applications to loop indefinitely, as they do interactive authentication and receive an error telling them to do interactive authentication, which they would then do.  

The bug has been fixed, so that during non-interactive auth an "interaction_required" error will still be returned. Also, during interactive authentication an error page will be directly displayed to the user.  

For greater details, see the change notices for [Azure AD protocols](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md#error-50105-has-been-fixed-to-not-return-interaction_required-during-interactive-authentication).

### Public preview - New claims transformation capabilities

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Enterprise Apps  
**Product capability:** SSO
 
The following new capabilities have been added to the claims transformations available for manipulating claims in tokens issued from Azure AD:
 
- Join() on NameID. Used to be restricted to joining an email format address with a verified domain. Now Join() can be used on the NameID claim in the same way as any other claim, so NameID transforms can be used to create Windows account style NameIDs or any other string. For now if the result is an email address, the Azure AD will still validate that the domain is one that is verified in the tenant.
- Substring(). A new transformation in the claims configuration UI allows extraction of defined position substrings such as five characters starting at character three - substring(3,5)
- Claims transformations. These transformations can now be performed on Multi-valued attributes, and can emit multi-valued claims. Microsoft Graph can now be used to read/write multi-valued directory schema extension attributes. [Learn more](../develop/active-directory-saml-claims-customization.md).

---

### Public Preview â€“ Flagged Sign-ins  

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Reporting  
**Product capability:** Monitoring & Reporting

---

### Public preview - Azure Active Directory workload identity federation

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Enterprise Apps  
**Product capability:** Developer Experience
 
Azure AD workload identity federation is a new capability that's in public preview. It frees developers from handling application secrets or certificates. This includes secrets in scenarios such as using GitHub Actions and building applications on Kubernetes. Rather than creating an application secret and using that to get tokens for that application, developers can instead use tokens provided by the respective platforms such as GitHub and Kubernetes without having to manage any secrets manually.[Learn more](../develop/workload-identity-federation.md).

### General availability - Google deprecation of Gmail sign-in support on embedded webviews on September 30, 2021

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** B2B  
**Product capability:** B2B/B2C
 
Google has deprecated Gmail sign-ins on Microsoft Teams mobile and custom apps that run Gmail authentications on embedded webviews on Sept. 30th, 2021.

If you would like to request an extension, impacted customers with affected OAuth client ID(s) should have received an email from Google Developers with the following information regarding a one-time policy enforcement extension, which must be completed by Jan 31, 2022.

To continue allowing your Gmail users to sign in and redeem, we strongly recommend that you refer toâ€¯[Embedded vs System Web](../develop/msal-net-web-browsers.md#embedded-vs-system-web-ui) UIâ€¯in the MSAL.NET documentation and modify your apps to use the system browser for sign-in. All MSAL SDKs use the system web-view by default. 

As a workaround, we are deploying the device login flow by October 8. Between today and until then, it is likely that it may not be rolled out to all regions yet (in which case, end-users will be met with an error screen until it gets deployed to your region.) 

For more details on the device login flow and details on requesting extension to Google, see [Add Google as an identity provider for B2B guest users](../external-identities/google-federation.md#deprecation-of-web-view-sign-in-support).

## September 2021

### Limits on the number of configured API permissions for an application registration will be enforced starting in October 2021

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Other  
**Product capability:** Developer Experience
 
Occasionally, application developers configure their apps to require more permissions than it's possible to grant. To prevent this from happening, we're enforcing a limit on the total number of required permissions that can be configured for an app registration.

The total number of required permissions for any single application registration must not exceed 400 permissions, across all APIs. The change to enforce this limit will begin rolling out no sooner than mid-October 2021. Applications exceeding the limit can't increase the number of permissions they're configured for. The existing limit on the number of distinct APIs for which permissions are required remains unchanged and can't exceed 50 APIs.

In the Azure portal, the required permissions are listed under Azure Active Directory > Application registrations > (select an application) > API permissions. Using Microsoft Graph or Microsoft Graph PowerShell, the required permissions are listed in the requiredResourceAccess property of an application entity. [Learn more](../enterprise-users/directory-service-limits-restrictions.md).

### Single Page Apps using the `spa` redirect URI type must use a CORS enabled browser for auth

**Type:** Known issue  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** Developer Experience
 
The modern Edge browser is now included in the requirement to provide an `Origin` header when redeeming a [single page app authorization code](../develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow.md#redirect-uri-setup-required-for-single-page-apps). A compatibility fix accidentally exempted the modern Edge browser from CORS controls, and that bug is being fixed during October. A subset of applications depended on CORS being disabled in the browser, which has the side effect of removing the `Origin` header from traffic. This is an unsupported configuration for using Azure AD, and these apps that depended on disabling CORS can no longer use modern Edge as a security workaround.  All modern browsers must now include the `Origin` header per HTTP spec, to ensure CORS is enforced. [Learn more](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md#the-device-code-flow-ux-will-now-include-an-app-confirmation-prompt).

## July 2021

### New Google sign-in integration for Azure AD B2C and B2B self-service sign-up and invited external users will stop working starting July 12, 2021

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** B2B  
**Product capability:** B2B/B2C
 

Previously we announced that [the exception for Embedded WebViews for Gmail authentication will expire in the second half of 2021](https://www.yammer.com/cepartners/threads/1188371962232832).

On July 7, 2021, we learned from Google that some of these restrictions will apply starting **July 12, 2021**. Azure AD B2B and B2C customers who set up a new Google ID sign-in in their custom or line of business applications to invite external users or enable self-service sign-up will have the restrictions applied immediately. As a result, end-users will be met with an error screen that blocks their Gmail sign-in if the authentication is not moved to a system webview. See the docs linked below for details. 

Most apps use system web-view by default, and will not be impacted by this change. This only applies to customers using embedded webviews (the non-default setting.) We advise customers to move their application's authentication to system browsers instead, prior to creating any new Google integrations. To learn how to move to system browsers for Gmail authentications, read the Embedded vs System Web UI section in the [Using web browsers (MSAL.NET)](../develop/msal-net-web-browsers.md#embedded-vs-system-web-ui) documentation. All MSAL SDKs use the system web-view by default. [Learn more](../external-identities/google-federation.md#deprecation-of-web-view-sign-in-support).

### Google sign-in on embedded web-views expiring September 30, 2021

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** B2B  
**Product capability:** B2B/B2C
 

About two months ago we announced that the exception for Embedded WebViews for Gmail authentication will expire in the second half of 2021. 

Recently, Google has specified the date to be **September 30, 2021**. 

Rolling out globally beginning September 30, 2021, Azure AD B2B guests signing in with their Gmail accounts will now be prompted to enter a code in a separate browser window to finish signing in on Microsoft Teams mobile and desktop clients. This applies to invited guests and guests who signed up using Self-Service Sign-Up. 

Azure AD B2C customers who have set up embedded webview Gmail authentications in their custom/line of business apps or have existing Google integrations, will no longer can let their users sign in with Gmail accounts. To mitigate this, make sure to modify your apps to use the system browser for sign-in. For more information, read the Embedded vs System Web UI section in the [Using web browsers (MSAL.NET)](../develop/msal-net-web-browsers.md#embedded-vs-system-web-ui) documentation. All MSAL SDKs use the system web-view by default. 

As the device login flow will start rolling out on September 30, 2021, it is likely that it may not be rolled out to your region yet (in which case, your end-users will be met with the error screen shown in the documentation until it gets deployed to your region.) 

For details on known impacted scenarios and what experience your users can expect, read [Add Google as an identity provider for B2B guest users](../external-identities/google-federation.md#deprecation-of-web-view-sign-in-support).

### New ARM API to manage PIM for Azure Resources and Azure AD roles

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Privileged Identity Management  
**Product capability:** Privileged Identity Management
 
An updated version of the PIM API for Azure Resource role and Azure AD role has been released.

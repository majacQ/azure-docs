# Azure AD Connect: Version release history

The Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) team regularly updates Azure AD Connect with new features and functionality. Not all additions are applicable to all audiences.

This article is designed to help you keep track of the versions that have been released, and to understand what the changes are in the latest version.

## Looking for the latest versions?

You can upgrade your AADConnect server from all supported versions with the latest versions:

 - If you are using **Windows Server 2016 or newer** you should use **Azure AD Connect V2.0**. You can download the latest version of Azure AD Connect 2.0 using [this link](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=47594). [Release notes for the latest V2.0 release](reference-connect-version-history.md#20280).
 - If you are still using an **older version of Windows Server** you should use **Azure AD Connect V1.6**. You can download the latest version of Azure AD Connect V1 using [this link](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=103336). [Release notes for the latest V1.6 release](reference-connect-version-history.md#16160).
 - We are only applying critical changes to the V1.x versions going forward, and you may not find some of the features and fixes for V2.0 in the V1.x releases - so you should upgrade to the V2.0 version as soon as possible. Most notably, there is an issue with the 1.16.4.2 build, where upgrading to this v1.6 build or any newer builds resets the group limit to 50k. When a server is upgraded to this build, or any newer 1.6 builds, then the customer should reapply the rules changes they applied when initially increasing the group membership limit to 250k before they enable sync for the server. 

This table is a list of related topics:

Required permissions | For permissions required to apply an update, see [accounts and permissions](reference-connect-accounts-permissions.md#upgrade).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **On 31 August 2022, all 1.x versions of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Connect will be retired because they include SQL Server 2012 components that will no longer be supported.** Either upgrade to the most recent version of Azure AD Connect (2.x version) by that date, or [evaluate and switch to Azure AD cloud sync](../cloud-sync/what-is-cloud-sync.md).
>
> You need to make sure you are running a recent version of Azure AD Connect to receive an optimal support experience.
>
> If you run a retired version of Azure AD Connect it may unexpectedly stop working and you may not have the latest security fixes, performance improvements, troubleshooting and diagnostic tools and service enhancements. Moreover, if you require support we may not be able to provide you with the level of service your organization needs.
>
> Go to this article to learn more about [Azure Active Directory Connect V2.0](whatis-azure-ad-connect-v2.md), what has changed in V2.0 and how this change impacts you.
>
> Please refer to [this article](./how-to-upgrade-previous-version.md) to learn more about how to upgrade Azure AD Connect to the latest version.
>
> For version history information on retired versions, see [Azure AD Connect version release history archive](reference-connect-version-history-archive.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Releasing a new version of Azure AD Connect is a process that requires several quality control step to ensure the operation functionality of the service, and while we go through this process the version number of a new release as well as the release status will be updated to reflect the most recent state.
>
> Not all releases of Azure AD Connect will be made available for auto upgrade. The release status will indicate whether a release is made available for auto upgrade or for download only. If auto upgrade was enabled on your Azure AD Connect server then that server will automatically upgrade to the latest version of Azure AD Connect that is released for auto upgrade. Note that not all Azure AD Connect configurations are eligible for auto upgrade.
>
> To clarify the use of Auto Upgrade, it is meant to push all important updates and critical fixes to you. This is not necessarily the latest version because not all versions will require/include a fix to a critical security issue (just one example of many). Critical issues would usually be addressed with a new version provided via Auto Upgrade. If there are no such issues, there are no updates pushed out using Auto Upgrade, and in general if you are using the latest auto upgrade version you should be good.
>
> However, if you'd like all the latest features and updates, the best way to see if there are any is to check this page and install them as you see fit.

## 1.6.16.0

> [!NOTE]
> This is an update release of Azure AD Connect. This version is intended to be used by customers who are running an older version of Windows Server and cannot upgrade their server to Windows Server 2016 or newer at this time. You cannot use this version to update an Azure AD Connect V2.0 server.
>
> This release is not supported on Windows Server 2016 or newer. This release includes SQL Server 2012 components and will be retired on August 31st 2022. You will need to upgrade your Server OS and AADConnect version before that date.
>
> There is an issue where upgrading to this v1.6 build or any newer builds resets the group membership limit to 50k. When a server is upgraded to this build, or any newer 1.6 builds, then the customer should reapply the rules changes they applied when initially increasing the group membership limit to 250k before they enable sync for the server. 

### Release status

10/13/2021: Released for download and auto upgrade.

### Bug fixes

- We fixed a bug where the Autoupgrade process attempted to upgrade AADConnect servers that are running older Windows OS version 2008 or 2008 R2 and failed. These versions of Windows Server are no longer supported. In this release we only attempt autoupgrade on machines that run Windows Server 2012 or newer.
- We fixed an issue where, under certain conditions, miisserver would be crashing due to access violation exception.

### Known Issues
 - There is an issue where upgrading to this v1.6 build or any newer builds resets the group membership limit to 50k. When a server is upgraded to this build, or any newer 1.6 builds, then the customer should reapply the rules changes they applied when initially increasing the group membership limit to 250k before they enable sync for the server. 

## 2.0.28.0

> [!NOTE]
> This is a maintenance update release of Azure AD Connect. This release requires Windows Server 2016 or newer.

### Release status

9/30/2021: Released for download only, not available for auto upgrade.

### Bug fixes

 - On the Group Writeback Permissions page in the Wizard we removed a download button for a PowerShell script and changed the text on the wizard page to include a learn more link, which links to an online article where the PowerShell script can be found.

 - We fixed a bug where the wizard was incorrectly blocking the installation when the .NET version on the server was greater than 4.6, due to missing registry keys. Those registry keys are not required and should only block installation if they are intentionally set to false.

 - We fixed a bug where an error would be thrown if phantom objects are found during during the initialization of a sync step. This would block the sync step or remove transient objects. The phantom objects are now ignored.
Note: A phantom object is a placeholder for an object which is not there or has not been seen yet, for example if a source object has a reference for a target object which is not there then we create the target object as a phantom.

### Functional changes

 - A change was made that allows a user to deselect objects and attributes from the inclusion list, even if they are in use. Instead of blocking this, we now provide a warning. 

## 1.6.14.2

> [!NOTE]
> This is an update release of Azure AD Connect. This version is intended to be used by customers who are running an older version of Windows Server and cannot upgrade their server to Windows Server 2016 or newer at this time. You cannot use this version to update an Azure AD Connect V2.0 server.  
> We will begin auto upgrading eligible tenants when this version is available for download, autoupgrade will take a few weeks to complete.
> There is an issue where upgrading to this v1.6 build or any newer builds resets the group membership limit to 50k. When a server is upgraded to this build, or any newer 1.6 builds, then the customer should reapply the rules changes they applied when initially increasing the group membership limit to 250k before they enable sync for the server. 

### Release status

9/21/2021: Released for download and auto upgrade.

### Functional changes

 - We added the latest versions of MIM Connectors (1.1.1610.0). More information can be found at [the release history page of the MiM connectors](/microsoft-identity-manager/reference/microsoft-identity-manager-2016-connector-version-history#1116100-september-2021)
 - We have added a configuration option to disable the Soft Matching feature in Azure AD Connect. We advise customers to disable soft matching unless they need it to take over cloud only accounts. This [article](/powershell/module/msonline/set-msoldirsyncfeature#example-2--block-soft-matching-for-the-tenant) shows how to disable Soft Matching.

### Bug fixes

 - We fixed a bug where the DesktopSSO settings were not persisted after upgrade from a previous version.
 - We fixed a bug that caused the Set-ADSync\*Permission cmdlets to fail.

## 2.0.25.1

> [!NOTE]
> This is a hotfix update release of Azure AD Connect. This release requires Windows Server 2016 or newer and fixes a security issue that is present in version 2.0 of Azure AD Connect, as well as some other bug fixes.

### Release status

9/14/2021: Released for download only, not available for auto upgrade.

### Bug fixes

 - We fixed a security issue where an unquoted path was used to point to the Azure AD Connect service. This path is now a quoted path.
 - Fixing an import config issue with writeback enabled when using the existing AD connector account.
 - We fixed an issue in Set-ADSyncExchangeHybridPermissions and other related cmdlets, which were broken from 1.6 due to an invalid inheritance type.
 - The cmdlet we published in a previous release to set the TLS version had an issue where it overwrites the keys, destroying any values that were in them. We fixed this by only creating a new key if one does not already exist. A warning is also added to let users know the TLS registry changes are not exclusive to Azure AD Connect and may impact other applications on the same server as well.
 - We added a check to enforce auto upgrade for V2.0 to require Windows Server 2016 or newer.
 - We added 'Replicating Directory Changes' permission in the Set-ADSyncBasicReadPermissions cmdlet.
 - We made a change to prevent UseExistingDatabase and import configuration from being used together since these could contain conflicting configuration settings.
 - We made a change to allow a user with the Application Admin role to change the App Proxy service configuration.
 - We removed the '(Preview)' label from the labels of Import/Export settings - this functionality has been in General Availability for some time now.
 - We change some labels that still refered to "Company Administrator" - we now use the role name "Global Administrator".
 - We created new AAD Kerberos PowerShell cmdlets "\*-AADKerberosServer" to add a Claims Transform rule to the AAD Service Principal.

### Functional changes

- We added the latest versions of MIM Connectors (1.1.1610.0). More information can be found at [the release history page of the MiM connectors](/microsoft-identity-manager/reference/microsoft-identity-manager-2016-connector-version-history#1116100-september-2021)
 - We have added a configuration option to disable the Soft Matching feature in Azure AD Connect. We advise customers to disable soft matching unless they need it to take over cloud only accounts. This [article](/powershell/module/msonline/set-msoldirsyncfeature#example-2--block-soft-matching-for-the-tenant) shows how to disable Soft Matching.

## 2.0.10.0

### Release status
8/19/2021: Released for download only, not available for auto upgrade.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a hotfix update release of Azure AD Connect. This release requires Windows Server 2016 or newer. This hotfix addresses an issue that is present in version 2.0 as well as in Azure AD Connect version 1.6. If you are running Azure AD Connect on an older Windows Server you should install the [1.6.13.0](#16130) build instead.

### Release status

8/19/2021: Released for download only, not available for auto upgrade.

### Known issues

 - Under certain circumstances the installer for this version will display an error mentioning that TLS 1.2 is not enabled and will stop the installation. This is due to an error in the code that verifies the registry setting for TLS 1.2. We will correct this in a future release. Customers who see this issue should follow the instructions for enabling TLS 1.2 that can be found in the article [TLS 1.2 enforcement for Azure AD Connect](reference-connect-tls-enforcement.md).

### Bug fixes

 - We fixed a bug where, when a domain is renamed, Password Hash Sync would fail with an error indicating "a specified cast is not valid" in the Event log. This is a regression from earlier builds.

## 1.6.13.0

> [!NOTE]
> This is a hotfix update release of Azure AD Connect. This release is intended for customers who are running Azure AD Connect on a server with Windows Server 2012 or 2012 R2.

8/19/2021: Released for download only, not available for auto upgrade.

### Bug fixes

> [!NOTE]
> This is a hotfix update release of Azure AD Connect. This release requires Windows Server 2016 or newer. This release addresses an issue that is present in version 2.0.8.0, this issue is not present in Azure AD Connect version 1.6.

 - We fixed a bug where, when syncing a large number of Password Hash Sync transactions, the Event log entry length would exceed the maximum allowed length for a Password Hash Sync event entry. We now split the lengthy log entry into multiple entries.

## 2.0.8.0

> [!NOTE]

> [!NOTE]
> This is a major release of Azure AD Connect. Please refer to the [Azure Active Directory V2.0 article](whatis-azure-ad-connect-v2.md) for more details.

### Release status

7/20/2021: Released for download only, not available for auto upgrade

### Functional changes

 - We have upgraded the LocalDB components of SQL Server to SQL 2019.
 - This release requires Windows Server 2016 or newer, due to the requirements of SQL Server 2019. Note that an in-place upgrade of Windows Server on an Azure AD Connect server is not supported, so you may need to use a [swing migration](how-to-upgrade-previous-version.md#swing-migration).
 - In this release we enforce the use of TLS 1.2. If you have enabled your Windows Server for TLS 1.2, AADConnect will use this protocol. If TLS 1.2 is not enabled on the server you will see an error message when attempting to install AADConnect and the installation will not continue until you have enabled TLS 1.2. Note that you can use the new "Set-ADSyncToolsTls12" cmdlets to enable TLS 1.2 on your server.
 - With this release, you can use a user with the user role "Hybrid Identity Administrator" to authenticate when you install Azure AD Connect. You no longer need the Global Administrator role for this.
 - We have upgraded the Visual C++ runtime library to version 14 as a prerequisite for SQL Server 2019.
 - This release uses the MSAL library for authentication, and we have removed the older ADAL library, which will be retired in 2022.
 - We no longer apply permissions on the AdminSDHolders, following Windows security guidance. We changed the parameter "SkipAdminSdHolders" to "IncludeAdminSdHolders" in the ADSyncConfig.psm1 module.
 - Passwords will now be reevaluated when an expired password is "unexpired", regardless of whether the password itself is changed. If for a user the password is set to "Must change password at next logon", and this flag is cleared (thus "unexpiring" the password) then the "unexpired" status and the password hash are synced to Azure AD, and when the user attempts to sign in in Azure AD they can use the unexpired password.
To sync an expired password from Active Directory to Azure Active Directory please use the [Synchronizing temporary passwords](how-to-connect-password-hash-synchronization.md#synchronizing-temporary-passwords-and-force-password-change-on-next-logon) feature in Azure AD Connect. Note that you will need to enable password writeback to use this feature, so the password the user updates is written back to Active Directory too.
 - We have added two new cmdlets to the ADSyncTools module to enable or retrieve TLS 1.2 settings from the Windows Server.
   - Get-ADSyncToolsTls12
   - Set-ADSyncToolsTls12

You can use these cmdlets to retrieve the TLS 1.2 enablement status, or set it as needed. Note that TLS 1.2 must be enabled on the server for the installation or AADConnect to succeed.

 -    We have revamped ADSyncTools with several new and improved cmdlets. The [ADSyncTools article](reference-connect-adsynctools.md) has more details about these cmdlets.
  The following cmdlets have been added or updated
    - Clear-ADSyncToolsMsDsConsistencyGuid
    - ConvertFrom-ADSyncToolsAadDistinguishedName
    - ConvertFrom-ADSyncToolsImmutableID
    - ConvertTo-ADSyncToolsAadDistinguishedName
    - ConvertTo-ADSyncToolsCloudAnchor
    - ConvertTo-ADSyncToolsImmutableID
    - Export-ADSyncToolsAadDisconnectors
    - Export-ADSyncToolsObjects
    - Export-ADSyncToolsRunHistory
    - Get-ADSyncToolsAadObject
    - Get-ADSyncToolsMsDsConsistencyGuid
    - Import-ADSyncToolsObjects
    - Import-ADSyncToolsRunHistory
    - Remove-ADSyncToolsAadObject
    - Search-ADSyncToolsADobject
    - Set-ADSyncToolsMsDsConsistencyGuid
    - Trace-ADSyncToolsADImport
    - Trace-ADSyncToolsLdapQuery
-    We now use the V2 endpoint for import and export and we fixed issue in the Get-ADSyncAADConnectorExportApiVersion cmdlet. You can read more about the V2 endpoint in the [Azure AD Connect sync V2 endpoint article](how-to-connect-sync-endpoint-api-v2.md).
-    We have added the following new user properties to sync from on-prem AD to Azure AD
    - employeeType
    - employeeHireDate
-    This release requires PowerShell version 5.0 or newer to be installed on the Windows Server. Note that this version is part of Windows Server 2016 and newer.
-    We increased the Group sync membership limits to 250k with the new V2 endpoint.
-    We have updated the Generic LDAP connector and the Generic SQL Connector to the latest versions. Read more about these connectors here:
    - [Generic LDAP Connector reference documentation](/microsoft-identity-manager/reference/microsoft-identity-manager-2016-connector-genericldap)
    - [Generic SQL Connector reference documentation](/microsoft-identity-manager/reference/microsoft-identity-manager-2016-connector-genericsql)
-    In the M365 Admin Center, we now report the AADConnect client version whenever there is export activity to Azure AD. This ensures that the M365 Admin Center always has the most up to date AADConnect client version, and that it can detect when you're using an outdated version

### Bug fixes

- We fixed an accessibility bug where the screen reader is announcing an incorrect role of the 'Learn More' link.
-    We fixed a bug where sync rules with large precedence values (i.e. 387163089) cause an upgrade to fail. We updated the sproc 'mms_UpdateSyncRulePrecedence' to cast the precedence number as an integer prior to incrementing the value.
-    We fixed a bug where group writeback permissions are not set on the sync account if a group writeback configuration is imported. We now set the group writeback permissions if group writeback is enabled on the imported configuration.
-    We updated the Azure AD Connect Health agent version to 3.1.110.0 to fix an installation failure.
-    We are seeing an issue with non-default attributes from exported configurations where directory extension attributes are configured. When importing these configurations to a new server/installation, the attribute inclusion list is overridden by the directory extension configuration step, so after import only default and directory extension attributes are selected in the sync service manager (non-default attributes are not included in the installation, so the user must manually reenable them from the sync service manager if they want their imported sync rules to work). We now refresh the AAD Connector before configuring directory extension to keep existing attributes from the attribute inclusion list.
-    We fixed an accessibility issues where the page header's font weight is set as "Light". Font weight is now set to "Bold" for the page title, which applies to the header of all pages.
-    The function Get-AdObject in ADSyncSingleObjectSync.ps1 has been renamed to Get-AdDirectoryObject to prevent ambiguity with the AD cmdlet.
-    The SQL function 'mms_CheckSynchronizationRuleHasUniquePrecedence' allow duplicates precedence on outbound sync rules on different connectors. We removed the condition that allows duplicate rule precedence.
-    We fixed a bug where the Single Object Sync cmdlet fails if the attribute flow data is null i.e. on exporting delete operation.
-    We fixed a bug where the installation fails because the ADSync bootstrap service cannot be started. We now add Sync Service Account to the Local Builtin User Group before starting the bootstrap service.
-    We fixed an accessibility issue where the active tab on AAD Connect wizard is not showing correct color on High Contrast theme. The selected color code was being overwritten due to missing condition in normal color code configuration.
-    We addressed an issue where users were allowed to deselect objects and attributes used in sync rules using the UI and PowerShell. We now show friendly error message if you try to deselect any attribute or object that is used in any sync rules.
-    We made some updates to the "migrate settings code" to check  and fix backward compatibility issue when the script is ran on an older version of Azure AD Connect.
-    Fixed a bug where, when PHS tries to look up an incomplete object, it does not use the same algorithm to resolve the DC as it used originally to fetch the passwords. In particular, it is ignoring affinitized DC information. The Incomplete object lookup should use the same logic to locate the DC in both instances.
-    We fixed a bug where AADConnect cannot read Application Proxy items using Microsoft Graph due to a permissions issue with calling Microsoft Graph directly based on AAD Connect client id. To fix this, we removed the dependency on Microsoft Graph and instead use AAD PowerShell to work with the App Proxy Application objects.
-    We removed the writeback member limit from 'Out to AD - Group SOAInAAD Exchange' sync rule
-    We fixed a bug where, when changing connector account permissions, if an object comes in scope that has not changed since the last delta import, a delta import will not import it. We now display warning alerting user of the issue.
-    We fixed an accessibility issue where the screen reader is not reading radio button position. We added added positional text to the radio button accessibility text field.
-    We updated the Pass-Thru Authentication Agent bundle. The older bundle did not have correct reply URL for HIP's first party application in US Gov.
-    We fixed a bug where there is a 'stopped-extension-dll-exception' on AAD connector export after clean installing AADConnect version 1.6.X.X, which defaults to using DirSyncWebServices API V2, using an existing database.    Previously the setting export version to v2 was only being done for upgrade, we changed so that it is set on clean install as well.
-    The "ADSyncPrep.psm1" module is no longer used and is removed from the installation.

### Known issues

-    The AADConnect wizard shows the "Import Synchronization Settings" option as "Preview", while this feature is generally Available.
-    Some Active Directory connectors may be installed in a different order when using the output of the migrate settings script to install the product.
-    The User Sign In options page in the Azure AD Connect wizard mentions "Company Administrator". This term is no longer used and needs to be replace by "Global Administrator".
-    The "Export settings" option is broken when the Sign In option has been configured to use PingFederate.
-    While Azure AD Connect can now be deployed using the Hybrid Identity Administrator role, configuring Self Service Password Reset or Single Sign On will still require user with the Global Administrator role.
-    When importing the AADConnect configuration while deploying to connect with a different tenant than the original AADConnect configuration, directory extension attributes are not configured correctly.

## 1.6.4.0

> [!NOTE]
> The Azure AD Connect sync V2 endpoint API is now available in these Azure environments:
> - Azure Commercial
> - Azure China cloud
> - Azure US Government cloud
> - This release will not be made available in the Azure German cloud

### Release status

### Release status

3/19/2021: Released for download, not available for auto upgrade

### Functional changes

 - Updated default sync rules to limit membership in written back groups to 50k members.
   - Added new default sync rules for limiting membership count in group writeback (Out to AD - Group Writeback Member Limit) and group sync to Azure Active Directory (Out to AAD - Group Writeup Member Limit) groups.
   - Added member attribute to the 'Out to AD - Group SOAInAAD - Exchange' rule to limit members in written back groups to 50k.
 - Updated Sync Rules to support Group Writeback v2.
   -If the "In from AAD - Group SOAInAAD" rule is cloned and AADConnect is upgraded.
     - The updated rule will be disabled by default and so the targetWritebackType will be null.
     - AADConnect will writeback all Cloud Groups (including Azure Active Directory Security Groups enabled for writeback) as Distribution Groups.
   -If the "Out to AD - Group SOAInAAD" rule is cloned and AADConnect is upgraded.
     - The updated rule will be disabled by default. However, a new sync rule "Out to AD - Group SOAInAAD - Exchange" which is added will be enabled.
     - Depending on the Cloned Custom Sync Rule's precedence, AADConnect will flow the Mail and Exchange attributes.
     - If the Cloned Custom Sync Rule does not flow some Mail and Exchange attributes, then new Exchange Sync Rule will add those attributes.
     - Note that Group Writeback V2 is in private preview at this moment and not publicly available.
 - Added support for [Selective Password hash Synchronization](./how-to-connect-selective-password-hash-synchronization.md)

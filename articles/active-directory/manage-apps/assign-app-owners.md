# Assign enterprise application owners

Assigning owners is a simple way to grant the ability to manage all aspects of Azure AD configuration for a specific application registration or enterprise application. As an owner, a user can manage the organization-specific configuration of the enterprise application, such as the single sign-on configuration, provisioning, and user assignments. An owner can also add or remove other owners. Unlike Global Administrators, owners can manage only the enterprise applications they own.

Only users can be owners of enterprise applications. Groups cannot be assigned as owners. Owners can add credentials to an application and use those credentials to impersonate the application’s identity. The application may have more permissions than the owner, and thus would be an elevation of privilege over what the owner has access to as a user or service principal. 

An application owner could potentially create or update users or other objects while impersonating the application, depending on the application's permissions. Owners of applications have the same permissions as application administrators scoped to an individual application. For more information, see [Azure AD built-in roles](../roles/permissions-reference.md#application-administrator). 

## Assign an owner

To assign an owner to an enterprise application:

1. Sign in to [your Azure AD organization](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview) with an account that is eligible for the **Application Administrator** role or the **Cloud Application Administrator** role for the organization.
2. Select **Enterprise applications**, and then select the application that you want to add an owner to.
3. Select **Owners**, and then select **Add** to get a list of user accounts that you can choose an owner from.
4. Search for and select the user account that you want to be an owner of the application.
5. Click **Select** to add the user account that you chose as an owner of the application.

> [!NOTE]
> If the user setting **Restrict access to Azure AD administration portal** is set to `Yes`, non-admin users will not be able to use the Azure portal to manage the applications they own. For more information about the actions that can be performed on owned enterprise applications, see [Owned enterprise applications](../fundamentals/users-default-permissions.md#owned-enterprise-applications).

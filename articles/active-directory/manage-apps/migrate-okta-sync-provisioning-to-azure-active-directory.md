# Tutorial: Migrate Okta sync provisioning to Azure AD Connect-based synchronization

In this tutorial, you'll learn how your organization can currently migrate User provisioning from Okta to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and migrate either User sync or Universal sync to Azure AD Connect. This capability will enable further provisioning into Azure AD and Office 365.

Migrating synchronization platforms isn't a small change. Each step of the process mentioned in this article should be validated against your own environment before you remove Azure AD Connect from staging mode or enable the Azure AD cloud provisioning agent.

## Prerequisites

When you switch from Okta provisioning to Azure AD, you have two choices. You can use either an Azure AD Connect server or Azure AD cloud provisioning. To understand the differences between the two, read the [comparison article from Microsoft](../cloud-sync/what-is-cloud-sync.md#comparison-between-azure-ad-connect-and-cloud-sync).

Azure AD cloud provisioning will be the most familiar migration path for Okta customers who use Universal or User sync. The cloud provisioning agents are lightweight. They can be installed on or near domain controllers like the Okta directory sync agents. Don't install them on the same server.

Use an Azure AD Connect server if your organization needs to take advantage of any of the following technologies when you synchronize users:

- Device synchronization: Hybrid Azure AD join or Hello for Business
- Passthrough authentication
- More than 150,000-object support
- Support for writeback

>[!NOTE]
>All prerequisites should be taken into consideration when you install Azure AD Connect or Azure AD cloud provisioning. To learn more before you continue with installation, see [Prerequisites for Azure AD Connect](../hybrid/how-to-connect-install-prerequisites.md).

## Confirm ImmutableID attribute synchronized by Okta

ImmutableID is the core attribute used to tie synchronized objects to their on-premises counterparts. Okta takes the Active Directory objectGUID of an on-premises object and converts it to a Base64 encoded string. Then, by default it stamps that string to the ImmutableID field in Azure AD.

You can connect to Azure AD PowerShell and examine the current ImmutableID value. If you've never used the Azure AD PowerShell module, run
`Install-Module AzureAD` in an administrative PowerShell session before you run the following commands:

```Powershell
Import-module AzureAD
Connect-AzureAD
```

If you already have the module, you might receive a warning to update to the latest version if it's out of date.

After the module is installed, import it and follow these steps to connect to the Azure AD service:

1. Enter your global administrator credentials in the modern authentication window.

1. After you connect to the tenant, verify the settings for your ImmutableID values. The example shown uses Okta defaults of objectGUID to ImmutableID.

   ![Screenshot that shows Okta defaults of objectGUID to ImmutableID.](./media/migrate-okta-sync-provisioning-to-azure-active-directory-connect-based-synchronization/okta-default-objectid.png)

1. There are several ways to manually confirm the objectGUID to Base64 conversion on-premises. For individual validation, use this example:

   ```PowerShell
   Get-ADUser onpremupn | fl objectguid
   $objectguid = 'your-guid-here-1010'
   [system.convert]::ToBase64String(([GUID]$objectGUID).ToByteArray())
   ```

   ![Screenshot that shows how to manually change Okta objectGUID to ImmutableID.](./media/migrate-okta-sync-provisioning-to-azure-active-directory-connect-based-synchronization/manual-objectguid.png)

## Mass validation methods for objectGUID

Before you cut over to Azure AD Connect, it's critical to validate that the ImmutableID values in Azure AD are going to exactly match their on-premises values.

The example will grab *all* on-premises Azure AD users and export a list of their objectGUID values and ImmutableID values already calculated to a CSV file.

1. Run these commands in PowerShell on a domain controller on-premises:

   ```PowerShell
   Get-ADUser -Filter * -Properties objectGUID | Select-Object
   UserPrincipalName, Name, objectGUID, @{Name = 'ImmutableID';
   Expression = {
   [system.convert\]::ToBase64String(([GUID\]\$_.objectGUID).ToByteArray())
   } } | export-csv C:\\Temp\\OnPremIDs.csv
   ```

   ![Screenshot that shows domain controller on-premises commands.](./media/migrate-okta-sync-provisioning-to-azure-active-directory-connect-based-synchronization/domain-controller.png)

1. Run these commands in an Azure AD PowerShell session to gather the already synchronized values:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzureADUser -all $true | Where-Object {$_.dirsyncenabled -like
   "true"} | Select-Object UserPrincipalName, @{Name = 'objectGUID';
   Expression = {
   [GUID][System.Convert]::FromBase64String($_.ImmutableID) } },
   ImmutableID | export-csv C:\\temp\\AzureADSyncedIDS.csv
   ```

   ![Screenshot that shows an Azure AD PowerShell session.](./media/migrate-okta-sync-provisioning-to-azure-active-directory-connect-based-synchronization/azure-ad-powershell.png)

   After you have both exports, confirm that the ImmutableID for each user matches.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >If your ImmutableID values in the cloud don't match objectGUID values, you've modified the defaults for Okta sync. You've likely chosen another attribute to determine ImmutableID values. Before you move on to the next section, it's critical to identify which source attribute is populating ImmutableID values. Ensure that you update the attribute Okta is syncing before you disable Okta sync.

## Install Azure AD Connect in staging mode

After you've prepared your list of source and destination targets, it's time to install an Azure AD Connect server. If you've opted to use Azure AD Connect cloud provisioning, skip this section.

1. Continue with [downloading and installing Azure AD Connect](../hybrid/how-to-connect-install-custom.md) to your chosen server.

1. On the **Identifying users** page, under **Select how users should be identified with Azure AD**, select the **Choose a specific attribute** option. Then, select **mS-DS-ConsistencyGUID** if you haven't modified the Okta defaults.

   >[!WARNING]
   >This is the most critical step on this page. Before you select **Next**, ensure that the attribute you're selecting for a source anchor is what *currently* populates your existing Azure AD users. If you select the wrong attribute, you must uninstall and reinstall Azure AD Connect to reselect this option.
   
   ![Screenshot that shows mS-DS-ConsistencyGuid.](./media/migrate-okta-sync-provisioning-to-azure-active-directory-connect-based-synchronization/consistency-guid.png)

1. On the **Configure** page, make sure to select the **Enable staging mode** checkbox. Then select **Install**.

   ![Screenshot that shows the Enable staging mode checkbox.](./media/migrate-okta-sync-provisioning-to-azure-active-directory-connect-based-synchronization/enable-staging-mode.png)

1. After the configuration is complete, select **Exit**.

   Before you exit the staging mode, verify that the ImmutableID values match properly.

1. Open **Synchronization Service** as an administrator.

   ![Screenshot that shows opening Synchronization Service.](./media/migrate-okta-sync-provisioning-to-azure-active-directory-connect-based-synchronization/open-sync-service.png)

1. Check that **Full Synchronization** to the domain.onmicrosoft.com connector space has users displaying under the **Connectors with Flow Updates** tab.

   ![Screenshot that shows the Connectors with Flow Updates tab.](./media/migrate-okta-sync-provisioning-to-azure-active-directory-connect-based-synchronization/connector-flow-update.png)

1. Verify there are no deletions pending in the export. Select the **Connectors** tab, and then highlight the domain.onmicrosoft.com connector space. Then select **Search Connector Space**.

   ![Screenshot that shows the Search Connector Space action.](./media/migrate-okta-sync-provisioning-to-azure-active-directory-connect-based-synchronization/search-connector-space.png)

1. In the **Search Connector Space** dialog, select the **Scope** dropdown and select **Pending Export**.

   ![Screenshot that shows Pending Export.](./media/migrate-okta-sync-provisioning-to-azure-active-directory-connect-based-synchronization/pending-export.png)

1. Select **Delete** and then select **Search**. If all objects have matched properly, there should be zero matching records for **Deletes**. Record any objects pending deletion and their on-premises values.

   ![Screenshot that shows deleted matching records.](./media/migrate-okta-sync-provisioning-to-azure-active-directory-connect-based-synchronization/delete-matching-records.png)

1. Clear **Delete**, and select **Add** and **Modify**, followed by a search. You should see update functions for all users currently being synchronized to Azure AD via Okta. Add any new objects that Okta isn't currently syncing, but that exist in the organizational unit (OU) structure that was selected during the Azure AD Connect installation.

   ![Screenshot that shows adding a new object.](./media/migrate-okta-sync-provisioning-to-azure-active-directory-connect-based-synchronization/add-new-object.png)

1. Double-clicking on updates shows what Azure AD Connect will communicate with Azure AD.

1. If there are any **add** functions for a user who already exists in Azure AD, their on-premises account doesn't match their cloud account. AD Connect has determined it will create a new object and record any new adds that are unexpected. Make sure to correct the ImmutableID value in Azure AD before you exit the staging mode.

   In this example, Okta stamped the **mail** attribute to the user's account, even though the on-premises value wasn't properly filled in. When Azure AD Connect takes over John Smith's account, the **mail** attribute is deleted from his object.

   Verify that your updates still include all attributes expected in Azure AD. If multiple attributes are being deleted, you might need to manually populate these on-premises AD values before you remove the staging mode.

   ![Screenshot that shows populating on-premises add values.](./media/migrate-okta-sync-provisioning-to-azure-active-directory-connect-based-synchronization/on-premises-ad-values.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >Before you continue to the next step, ensure all user attributes are syncing properly and show on the **Pending Export** tab as expected. If they're deleted, make sure their ImmutableID values match and the user is in one of the selected OUs for synchronization.

## Install Azure AD cloud sync agents

After you've prepared your list of source and destination targets, it's time to [install and configure Azure AD cloud sync agents](../cloud-sync/tutorial-single-forest.md). If you've opted to use an Azure AD Connect server, skip this section.

## Disable Okta provisioning to Azure AD

After you've verified the Azure AD Connect installation and your pending exports are in order, it's time to disable Okta provisioning to Azure AD.

1. Go to your Okta portal, select **Applications**, and then select your Okta app used to provision users to Azure AD. Open the **Provisioning** tab and select the **Integration** section.

   ![Screenshot that shows the Integration section in Okta.](./media/migrate-okta-sync-provisioning-to-azure-active-directory-connect-based-synchronization/integration-section.png)

1. Select **Edit**, clear the **Enable API integration** option and select **Save**.

   ![Screenshot that shows editing the Enable API integration in Okta.](./media/migrate-okta-sync-provisioning-to-azure-active-directory-connect-based-synchronization/edit-api-integration.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >If you have multiple Office 365 apps handling provisioning to Azure AD, ensure they're all switched off.

## Disable staging mode in Azure AD Connect

After you disable Okta provisioning, the Azure AD Connect server is ready to begin synchronizing objects. If you've chosen to go with Azure AD cloud sync agents, skip this section.

1. Run the installation wizard from the desktop again and select **Configure**.

   ![Screenshot that shows the Azure AD Connect server.](./media/migrate-okta-sync-provisioning-to-azure-active-directory-connect-based-synchronization/azure-ad-connect-server.png)

1. Select **Configure staging mode** and then select **Next**. Enter your global administrator credentials.

   ![Screenshot that shows the Configure staging mode option.](./media/migrate-okta-sync-provisioning-to-azure-active-directory-connect-based-synchronization/configure-staging-mode.png)

1. Clear the **Enable staging mode** option and select **Next**.

   ![Screenshot that shows clearing the Enable staging mode option.](./media/migrate-okta-sync-provisioning-to-azure-active-directory-connect-based-synchronization/uncheck-enable-staging-mode.png)

1. Select **Configure** to continue.

   ![Screenshot that shows selecting the Configure button.](./media/migrate-okta-sync-provisioning-to-azure-active-directory-connect-based-synchronization/ready-to-configure.png)

1. After the configuration completes, open the **Synchronization Service** as an administrator. View the **Export** on the domain.onmicrosoft.com connector. Verify that all additions, updates, and deletions are done as expected.

   ![Screenshot that shows verifying the sync service.](./media/migrate-okta-sync-provisioning-to-azure-active-directory-connect-based-synchronization/verify-sync-service.png)

You've now successfully migrated to Azure AD Connect server-based provisioning. Updates and expansions to the feature set of Azure AD Connect can be done by rerunning the installation wizard.

## Enable cloud sync agents

After you disable Okta provisioning, the Azure AD cloud sync agent is ready to begin synchronizing objects. Return to the [Azure AD portal](https://aad.portal.azure.com/).

1. Modify the **Configuration** profile to **Enabled**.

1. Return to the provisioning menu and select **Logs**.

1. Evaluate that the provisioning connector has properly updated in-place objects. The cloud sync agents are nondestructive. They'll fail their updates if a match didn't occur properly.

1. If a user is mismatched, make the necessary updates to bind the ImmutableID values. Then restart the cloud provisioning sync.

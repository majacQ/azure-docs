## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Perception United States (Non-UltiPro)

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Perception United States (Non-UltiPro) using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Perception United States (Non-UltiPro).

    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Perception United States (Non-UltiPro) SSO](#configure-perception-united-states-non-ultipro-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Perception United States (Non-UltiPro) test user](#create-perception-united-states-non-ultipro-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Perception United States (Non-UltiPro) that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

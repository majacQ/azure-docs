# Make resources more secure with Azure Advisor

Azure Advisor provides you with a consistent, consolidated view of recommendations for all your Azure resources. It integrates with Microsoft Defender for Cloud to bring you security recommendations. You can get security recommendations from the **Security** tab on the Advisor dashboard.

Defender for Cloud helps you prevent, detect, and respond to threats with increased visibility into and control over the security of your Azure resources. It periodically analyzes the security state of your Azure resources. When Defender for Cloud identifies potential security vulnerabilities, it creates recommendations. The recommendations guide you through the process of configuring the controls you need. 

For more information about security recommendations, see [Review your security recommendations in Microsoft Defender for Cloud](../defender-for-cloud/review-security-recommendations.md).

## How to access Security recommendations in Azure Advisor

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and then open [Advisor](https://aka.ms/azureadvisordashboard).

2.	On the Advisor dashboard, click the **Security** tab.

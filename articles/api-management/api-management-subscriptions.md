# Subscriptions in Azure API Management

In Azure API Management, *subscriptions* are the most common way for API consumers to access APIs published through an API Management instance. This article provides an overview of the concept.

## What are subscriptions?

By publishing APIs through API Management, you can easily secure API access using subscription keys. Consume the published APIs by including a valid subscription key in the HTTP requests when calling to those APIs. Without a valid subscription key, the calls will:
* Be rejected immediately by the API Management gateway. 
* Not be forwarded to the back-end services.

To access APIs, you'll need a subscription and a subscription key. A *subscription* is a named container for a pair of subscription keys. 

Regularly regenerating keys is a common security precaution, so most Azure products requiring a subscription key will generate keys in pairs. Each application using the service can switch from *key A* to *key B* and regenerate key A with minimal disruption, and vice versa. 

In addition,

* Developers can get subscriptions without approval from API publishers. 
* API publishers can create subscriptions directly for API consumers.

> [!TIP]
> API Management also supports other mechanisms for securing access to APIs, including the following examples:
> - [OAuth2.0](api-management-howto-protect-backend-with-aad.md)
> - [Client certificates](api-management-howto-mutual-certificates-for-clients.md)
> - [Restrict caller IPs](./api-management-access-restriction-policies.md#RestrictCallerIPs)

## Scope of subscriptions

Subscriptions can be associated with various scopes: product, all APIs, or an individual API.

### Subscriptions for a product

Traditionally, subscriptions in API Management were associated with a single [API product](api-management-terminology.md) scope. Developers:
* Found the list of products on the developer portal. 
* Submitted subscription requests for the products they wanted to use. 
* Use the keys in those subscriptions (approved either automatically or by API publishers) to access all APIs in the product. 
    * You can access APIs with or without the subscription key regardless of subscription scope (product, global, or API).

Currently, the developer portal only shows the product scope subscriptions under the **User Profile** section.

> [!TIP]
> Under certain scenarios, API publishers might want to publish an API product to the public without the requirement of subscriptions. They can deselect the **Require subscription** option on the **Settings** page of the product in the Azure portal. As a result, all APIs under the product can be accessed without an API key.

### Subscriptions for all APIs or an individual API

With the addition of the [Consumption](https://aka.ms/apimconsumptionblog) tier of API Management, subscription key management is more streamlined. 

#### Two more subscription scopes

Subscription scopes aren't limited to an API product. You can create keys that grant access to either:
* a single API, or 
* All APIs within an API Management instance. 

You don't need to create a product before adding APIs to it. 

Each API Management instance comes with an immutable, all-APIs subscription (also called an *all-access* subscription). This built-in subscription makes it straightforward to test and debug APIs within the test console.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using an API-scoped subscription or the all-access subscription, any [policies](api-management-howto-policies.md) configured at the product scope aren't applied to that subscription.

#### Standalone subscriptions

API Management now allows *standalone* subscriptions. You no longer need to associate subscriptions with a developer account. This feature proves useful in scenarios similar to several developers or teams sharing a subscription.

Creating a subscription without assigning an owner makes it a standalone subscription. To grant developers and the rest of your team access to the standalone subscription key, either:
* Manually share the subscription key.
* Use a custom system to make the subscription key available to your team.

#### Creating subscriptions in Azure portal

API publishers can [create subscriptions](api-management-howto-create-subscriptions.md) directly in the Azure portal:

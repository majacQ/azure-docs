# Form Recognizer business card model

The business card model combines powerful Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities with deep learning models to analyze and extract key information from business card images. The API analyzes printed business cards; extracts key information such as first name, last name, company name, email address, and phone number;  and returns a structured JSON data representation.

### Try Form Recognizer

See how data, including name, job title, address, email, and company name, is extracted from business cards using the Form Recognizer Studio or our Sample Labeling tool. You'll need the following:

* An Azure subscription—you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/)

* A [Form Recognizer instance](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFormRecognizer) in the Azure portal. You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service. After your resource deploys, select **Go to resource** to get your API key and endpoint.

#### Form Recognizer Studio (preview)

> [!NOTE]
> Form Recognizer studio is available with the preview (v3.0) API.

1. On the Form Recognizer Studio home page, select **Business cards**

1. You can analyze the sample business card or select the **+ Add** button to upload your own sample.

1. Select the **Analyze** button:

    > [!div class="nextstepaction"]
    > [Try Form Recognizer Studio](https://formrecognizer.appliedai.azure.com/studio/prebuilt?formType=businessCard)

#### Sample Labeling tool

You will need a business card document. You can use our [sample business card document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/master/curl/form-recognizer/businessCard.png).

  1. On the Sample Labeling tool home page, select **Use prebuilt model to get data**.

  1. Select **Business card** from the **Form Type** dropdown menu:

## Input requirements

* For best results, provide one clear photo or high-quality scan per document.
* Supported file formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, and PDF (text-embedded or scanned). Text-embedded PDFs are best to eliminate the possibility of error in character extraction and location.
* For PDF and TIFF, up to 2000 pages can be processed (with a free tier subscription, only the first two pages are processed).
* The file size must be less than 50 MB.
* Image dimensions must be between 50 x 50 pixels and 10000 x 10000 pixels.
* PDF dimensions are up to 17 x 17 inches, corresponding to Legal or A3 paper size, or smaller.
* The total size of the training data is 500 pages or less.
* If your PDFs are password-locked, you must remove the lock before submission.
* For unsupervised learning (without labeled data):
  * Data must contain keys and values.
  * Keys must appear above or to the left of the values; they can't appear below or to the right.

> [!NOTE]
> The [Sample Labeling tool](https://fott-2-1.azurewebsites.net/) does not support the BMP file format. This is a limitation of the tool not the Form Recognizer Service.

## Supported languages and locales

>[!NOTE]
 > It's not necessary to specify a locale. This is an optional parameter. The Form Recognizer deep-learning technology will auto-detect the language of the text in your image.

| Model | Language—Locale code | Default |
|--------|:----------------------|:---------|
|Business card| <ul><li>English (United States)—en-US</li><li> English (Australia)—en-AU</li><li>English (Canada)—en-CA</li><li>English (United Kingdom)—en-GB</li><li>English (India)—en-IN</li></ul>  | Autodetected |

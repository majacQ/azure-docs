# Form Recognizer invoice model

 The invoice model combines powerful Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities with deep learning models to analyze and extract key fields and line items from sales invoices.  Invoices can be of various formats and quality including phone-captured images, scanned documents, and digital PDFs. The API analyzes invoice text; extracts key information such as customer name, billing address, due date, and amount due; and returns a structured JSON data representation.

**Sample invoice processed with [Form Recognizer Studio](https://formrecognizer.appliedai.azure.com/studio/prebuilt?formType=invoice)**:

### Try Form Recognizer

See how data, including customer information, vendor details, and line items, is extracted from invoices using  the Form Recognizer Studio or our Sample Labeling tool. You'll need the following:

* An Azure subscription—you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/)

* A [Form Recognizer instance](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFormRecognizer) in the Azure portal. You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service. After your resource deploys, select **Go to resource** to get your API key and endpoint.

#### Form Recognizer Studio (preview)

1. On the Form Recognizer Studio home page, select **Invoices**

1. You can analyze the sample invoice or select the **+ Add** button to upload your own sample.

1. Select the **Analyze** button:

> [Try Form Recognizer Studio](https://formrecognizer.appliedai.azure.com/studio/prebuilt?formType=invoice)

#### Sample Labeling tool

You will need an invoice document. You can use our [sample invoice document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/master/curl/form-recognizer/sample-invoice.pdf).

1. On the Sample Labeling tool home page, select **Use prebuilt model to get data**.

1. Select **Invoice** from the **Form Type** dropdown menu:

## Input requirements

* For best results, provide one clear photo or high-quality scan per document.
* Supported file formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, and PDF (text-embedded or scanned). Text-embedded PDFs are best to eliminate the possibility of error in character extraction and location.
* For PDF and TIFF, up to 2000 pages can be processed (with a free tier subscription, only the first two pages are processed).
* The file size must be less than 50 MB.
* Image dimensions must be between 50 x 50 pixels and 10000 x 10000 pixels.
* PDF dimensions are up to 17 x 17 inches, corresponding to Legal or A3 paper size, or smaller.
* The total size of the training data is 500 pages or less.
* If your PDFs are password-locked, you must remove the lock before submission.
* For unsupervised learning (without labeled data):
  * Data must contain keys and values.
  * Keys must appear above or to the left of the values; they can't appear below or to the right.

> [!NOTE]
> The [Sample Labeling tool](https://fott-2-1.azurewebsites.net/) does not support the BMP file format. This is a limitation of the tool not the Form Recognizer Service.

# Use Form Recognizer SDKs or REST API

 In this how-to guide, you'll learn how to add Form Recognizer to your applications and workflows using an SDK, in a programming language of your choice, or the REST API. Azure Form Recognizer is a cloud-based Azure Applied AI Service that uses machine learning to extract and analyze form fields, text, and tables from your documents. We recommend that you use the free service when you're learning the technology. Remember that the number of free pages is limited to 500 per month.

You'll use the following APIs to extract structured data from forms and documents:

* [Authenticate the client](#authenticate-the-client)
* [Analyze Layout](#analyze-layout)
* [Analyze receipts](#analyze-receipts)
* [Analyze business cards](#analyze-business-cards)
* [Analyze invoices](#analyze-invoices)
* [Analyze ID documents](#analyze-id-documents)
* [Train a custom model](#train-a-custom-model)
* [Analyze forms with a custom model](#analyze-forms-with-a-custom-model)
* [Manage custom models](#manage-custom-models)

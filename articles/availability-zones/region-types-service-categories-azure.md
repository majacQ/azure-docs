# Azure services

Availability of services across Azure regions depends on a region's type. There are two types of regions in Azure: *recommended* and *alternate*.

- **Recommended**: These regions provide the broadest range of service capabilities and currently support availability zones. Designated in the Azure portal as **Recommended**.
- **Alternate**: These regions extend Azure's footprint within a data residency boundary where a recommended region currently exists. Alternate regions help to optimize latency and provide a second region for disaster recovery needs but don't support availability zones. Azure conducts regular assessments of alternate regions to determine if they should become recommended regions. Designated in the Azure portal as **Other**.

## Service categories across region types

Azure services are grouped into three categories: *foundational*, *mainstream*, and *strategic*. Azure's general policy on deploying services into any given region is primarily driven by region type, service categories, and customer demand.

- **Foundational**: Available in all recommended and alternate regions when the region is generally available, or within 90 days of a new foundational service becoming generally available.
- **Mainstream**: Available in all recommended regions within 90 days of the region general availability. Demand-driven in alternate regions, and many are already deployed into a large subset of alternate regions.
- **Strategic** (previously Specialized): Targeted service offerings, often industry-focused or backed by customized hardware. Demand-driven availability across regions, and many are already deployed into a large subset of recommended regions.

To see which services are deployed in a region and the future roadmap for preview or general availability of services in a region, see [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/).

If a service offering isn't available in a region, contact your Microsoft sales representative for more information and to explore options.

| Region type | Non-regional | Foundational | Mainstream | Strategic | Availability zones | Data residency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Recommended | **Y** | **Y** | **Y** | Demand-driven | **Y** | **Y** |
| Alternate | **Y** | **Y** | Demand-driven | Demand-driven | N/A | **Y** |

## Available services by category

Azure assigns service categories as foundational, mainstream, and strategic at general availability. Typically, services start as a strategic service and are upgraded to mainstream and foundational as demand and use grow.

Azure services are presented in the following tables by category. Note that some services are non-regional. That means they're available globally regardless of region. For information and a complete list of non-regional services, see [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/).

### Strategic Services
As mentioned previously, Azure classifies services into three categories: foundational, mainstream, and strategic. Service categories are assigned at general availability. Often, services start their lifecycle as a strategic service and as demand and utilization increases may be promoted to mainstream or foundational. The following table lists strategic services.

Older generations of services or virtual machines aren't listed. For more information, see [Previous generations of virtual machine sizes](../virtual-machines/sizes-previous-gen.md).

To learn more about preview services that aren't yet in general availability and to see a listing of these services, see [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/). For a complete listing of services that support availability zones, see [Azure services that support availability zones](az-region.md).

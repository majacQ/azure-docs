# What is Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes?

With Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes, you can attach and configure Kubernetes clusters running anywhere. You can connect your clusters running on other public cloud providers (GCP, AWS) or clusters running on your on-premise data center (on VMware vSphere, Azure Stack HCI) to Azure Arc. When you connect a Kubernetes cluster to Azure Arc, it will:
* Get an Azure Resource Manager representation with a unique ID.
* Be placed in an Azure subscription and resource group.
* Receive tags just like any other Azure resource.

Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes supports industry-standard SSL to secure data in transit. For the connected clusters, data at rest is stored encrypted in an Azure Cosmos DB database to ensure data confidentiality.

Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes supports the following scenarios for the connected clusters: 

* [Connect Kubernetes](quickstart-connect-cluster.md) running outside of Azure for inventory, grouping, and tagging.

* Deploy applications and apply configuration using [GitOps-based configuration management](tutorial-use-gitops-connected-cluster.md). 

* View and monitor your clusters using [Azure Monitor for containers](../../azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-enable-arc-enabled-clusters.md?toc=/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/toc.json).

* Enforce threat protection using [Microsoft Defender for Kubernetes](../../defender-for-cloud/defender-for-kubernetes-azure-arc.md?toc=/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/toc.json).

* Apply policy definitions using [Azure Policy for Kubernetes](../../governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes.md?toc=/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/toc.json).

* Use [Azure Active Directory for authentication and authorization checks](azure-rbac.md) on your cluster.

* Securely access your Kubernetes cluster from anywhere without opening inbound port on firewall using [Cluster Connect](cluster-connect.md).

* Deploy [Open Service Mesh](tutorial-arc-enabled-open-service-mesh.md) on top of your cluster for observability and policy enforcement on service-to-service interactions

* Deploy machine learning workloads using [Azure Machine Learning for Kubernetes clusters](../../machine-learning/how-to-attach-arc-kubernetes.md?toc=/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/toc.json).

* Create [custom locations](./custom-locations.md) as target locations for deploying Azure Arc-enabled Data Services (SQL Managed Instances, PostgreSQL Hyperscale.), [App Services on Azure Arc](../../app-service/overview-arc-integration.md) (including web, function, and logic apps) and [Event Grid on Kubernetes](../../event-grid/kubernetes/overview.md).

## Supported Kubernetes distributions

Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes works with any Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) certified Kubernetes clusters. The Azure Arc team has worked with [key industry partners to validate conformance](./validation-program.md) of their Kubernetes distributions with Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes.

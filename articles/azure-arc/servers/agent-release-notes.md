# What's new with Azure Arc-enabled servers agent

The Azure Connected Machine agent receives improvements on an ongoing basis. To stay up to date with the most recent developments, this article provides you with information about:

- The latest releases
- Known issues
- Bug fixes

This page is updated monthly, so revisit it regularly. If you're looking for items older than six months, you can find them in [archive for What's new with Azure Arc-enabled servers agent](agent-release-notes-archive.md).

## November 2021

Version 1.13

### Fixed

- Improved reliability when installing or upgrading the agent.

### New features

- Local configuration of agent settings now available using the [azcmagent config command](manage-agent.md#config).
- Proxy server settings can be [configured using agent-specific settings](manage-agent.md#update-or-remove-proxy-settings) instead of environment variables.
- Extension operations will execute faster using a new notification pipeline. You may need to adjust your firewall or proxy server rules to allow the new network addresses for this notification service (see [networking configuration](agent-overview.md#networking-configuration)). The extension manager will fall back to the existing behavior of checking every 5 minutes when the notification service cannot be reached.
- Detection of the AWS account ID, instance ID, and region information for servers running in Amazon Web Services.

## October 2021

Version 1.12

### Fixed

- Improved reliability when validating signatures of extension packages.
- `azcmagent_proxy remove` command on Linux now correctly removes environment variables on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and related distributions.
- `azcmagent logs` now includes the computer name and timestamp to help disambiguate log files.

## September 2021

Version 1.11

### Fixed

- The agent can now be installed on Windows systems with the [System objects: Require case insensitivity for non-Windows subsystems](/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/system-objects-require-case-insensitivity-for-non-windows-subsystems) policy set to Disabled.
- The guest configuration policy agent will now automatically retry if an error is encountered during service start or restart events.
- Fixed an issue that prevented guest configuration audit policies from successfully executing on Linux machines.

## August 2021

Version 1.10

### Fixed

- The guest configuration policy agent can now configure and remediate system settings. Existing policy assignments continue to be audit-only. Learn more about the Azure Policy [guest configuration remediation options](../../governance/policy/concepts/guest-configuration-policy-effects.md).
- The guest configuration policy agent now restarts every 48 hours instead of every 6 hours.

## July 2021

Version 1.9

## New features

Added support for the Indonesian language

### Fixed

Fixed a bug that prevented extension management in the West US 3 region

Version 1.8

### New features

- Improved reliability when installing the Azure Monitor Agent extension on Red Hat and CentOS systems
- Added agent-side enforcement of max resource name length (54 characters)
- Guest Configuration policy improvements:
  - Added support for PowerShell-based Guest Configuration policies on Linux operating systems
  - Added support for multiple assignments of the same Guest Configuration policy on the same server
  - Upgraded PowerShell Core to version 7.1 on Windows operating systems

### Fixed

- The agent will continue running if it is unable to write service start/stop events to the Windows application event log

## Next steps

- Before evaluating or enabling Azure Arc-enabled servers across multiple hybrid machines, review [Connected Machine agent overview](agent-overview.md) to understand requirements, technical details about the agent, and deployment methods.
- Review the [Planning and deployment guide](plan-at-scale-deployment.md) to plan for deploying Azure Arc-enabled servers at any scale and implement centralized management and monitoring.

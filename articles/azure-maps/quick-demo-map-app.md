# Quickstart: Create an interactive search map with Azure Maps

In this quickstart, you will learn how to use Azure Maps to create a map that gives users an interactive search experience. It walks you through these basic steps:

* Create your own Azure Maps account.
* Get your primary key to use in the demo web application.
* Download and open the demo map application.

This quickstart uses the Azure Maps Web SDK, however the Azure Maps service can be used with any map control, such as these popular [open-source map controls](open-source-projects.md#third-part-map-control-plugins) that the Azure Maps team has created plugin's for.

## Prerequisites

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

* Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

## Create an Azure Maps account

Create a new Azure Maps account with the following steps:

1. In the upper left-hand corner of the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), click **Create a resource**.
2. In the *Search the Marketplace* box, type **Azure Maps**.
3. From the *Results*, select **Azure Maps**. Click **Create** button that appears below the map.
4. On the **Create Maps Account** page, enter the following values:
    * The *Subscription* that you want to use for this account.
    * The *Resource group* name for this account. You may choose to *Create new* or *Use existing* resource group.
    * The *Name* of your new account.
    * The *Pricing tier* for this account.
    * Read the *License* and *Privacy Statement*, and check the checkbox to accept the terms.
    * Click the **Create** button.

## Get the primary key for your account

Once your Maps account is successfully created, retrieve the primary key that enables you to query the Maps APIs.

1. Open your Maps account in the portal.
2. In the settings section, select **Authentication**.
3. Copy the **Primary Key** to your clipboard. Save it locally to use later in this tutorial.

>[!NOTE]
> This quickstart uses the [Shared Key](azure-maps-authentication.md#shared-key-authentication) authentication approach for demonstration purposes, but the preferred approach for any production environment is to use [Azure Active Directory](azure-maps-authentication.md#azure-ad-authentication) authentication.

## Download and update the Azure Maps demo

1. Go to [interactiveSearch.html](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/AzureMapsCodeSamples/blob/master/AzureMapsCodeSamples/Tutorials/interactiveSearch.html). Copy the contents of the file.
2. Save the contents of this file locally as **AzureMapDemo.html**. Open it in a text editor.
3. Add the **Primary Key** value you got in the preceding section
    1. Comment out all of the code in the `authOptions` function, this code is used for Azure Active Directory authentication.
    1. Uncomment the last two lines in the `authOptions` function, this code is used for Shared Key authentication, the approach being used in this quickstart.
    1. Replace `<Your Azure Maps Key>` with the **Primary Key** value from the preceding section.

## Open the demo application

1. Open the file **AzureMapDemo.html** in a browser of your choice.
2. Observe the map shown of the City of Los Angeles. Zoom in and out to see how the map automatically renders with more or less information depending on the zoom level.
3. Change the default center of the map. In the **AzureMapDemo.html** file, search for the variable named **center**. Replace the longitude, latitude pair value for this variable with the new values **[-74.0060, 40.7128]**. Save the file and refresh your browser.
4. Try out the interactive search experience. In the search box on the upper-left corner of the demo web application, search for **restaurants**.
5. Move your mouse over the list of addresses and locations that appear below the search box. Notice how the corresponding pin on the map pops out information about that location. For privacy of private businesses, fictitious names and addresses are shown.

## Clean up resources

>[!WARNING]
>The tutorials listed in the [Next Steps](#next-steps) section detail how to use and configure Azure Maps with your account. Don't clean up the resources created in this quickstart if you plan to continue to the tutorials.

If you don't plan to continue to the tutorials, take these steps to clean up the resources:

1. Close the browser that runs the **AzureMapDemo.html** web application.
2. Navigate to the Azure portal page. Select **All resources** from the main portal page. Or, click on the menu icon in the upper left-hand corner. Select **All resources**.
3. Click on your Azure Maps account. At the top of the page, click **Delete**.

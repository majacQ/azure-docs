# Discover how customers are using your application with Application Insights Funnels

Understanding the customer experience is of the utmost importance to your business. If your application involves multiple stages, you need to know if most customers are progressing through the entire process, or if they're ending the process at some point. The progression through a series of steps in a web application is known as a *funnel*. You can use Application Insights Funnels to gain insights into your users, and monitor step-by-step conversion rates. 

## Create your funnel
Before you create your funnel, decide on the question you want to answer. For example, you might want to know how many users are viewing the home page, viewing a customer profile, and creating a ticket. 

To create a funnel:

1. In the **Funnels** tab, select **Edit**.
1. Choose your *Top step*.

1. To apply filters to the step select **Add filters**, which will appear after you choose an item for the top step.
1. Then choose your *Second step* and so on.
1. Select the **View** tab to see your funnel results

# Impact analysis with Application Insights

Impact analyzes how load times and other properties influence conversion rates for various parts of your app. To put it more precisely, it discovers how **any dimension** of a **page view**, **custom event**, or **request** affects the usage of a different **page view** or **custom event**. 

## Still not sure what Impact does?

One way to think of Impact is as the ultimate tool for settling arguments with someone on your team about how slowness in some aspect of your site is affecting whether users stick around. While users may tolerate a certain amount of slowness, Impact gives you insight into how best to balance optimization and performance to maximize user conversion.

But analyzing performance is just a subset of Impact's capabilities. Since Impact supports custom events and dimensions, answering questions like how does user browser choice correlate with different rates of conversion are just a few clicks away.

> [!NOTE]
> Your Application Insights resource must contain page views or custom events to use the Impact analysis workbook. [Learn how to set up your app to collect page views automatically with the Application Insights JavaScript SDK](./javascript.md). Also keep in mind that since you are analyzing correlation, sample size matters.

## Impact Analytics Workbook 

To use the Impact Analytics Workbook, in your Application Insights resources navigate to **Usage** > **Impact** and select **Impact Analysis Workbook**. Or in the  **Workbooks** tab select **Public Templates** then select **User Impact Analysis** under *Usage*.

### Using the workbook

:::image type="content" source="./media/usage-impact/selected-event.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where to choose an initial page view, custom event, or request." lightbox="./media/usage-impact/selected-event.png":::

1. Select an event from the **Selected event** dropdown
2. Select a metric in **analyze how its** dropdown
3. Select an event in  **impacting event** dropdown 
1. If you liked to add a filter to  do so in **Add selected event filters** and/or **Add impacting event filters**.


## Is page load time impacting how many people convert on my page?

To begin answering questions with the Impact workbook, choose an initial page view, custom event, or request.

1. Select an event from the **Selected event** dropdown.
2. Leave the **analyze how its** dropdown on the default selection of **Duration** (In this context **Duration** is an alias for **Page Load Time**.)
3. For the **impacting event** dropdown, select a custom event. This event should correspond to a UI element on the page view you selected in step 1.

## What if I’m tracking page views or load times in custom ways?

Impact supports both standard and custom properties and measurements. Use whatever you want. Instead of duration,
use filters on the primary and secondary events to get more specific.

## Do users from different countries or regions convert at different rates?

1. Select an event from the **Selected Event** dropdown.
2. Choose “Country or region” in **analyze how its** dropdown
3. For the **impacting event** dropdown, select a custom event that corresponds to a UI element on the page view you chose in step 1.

## How does the Impact analysis workbook calculate these conversion rates?

Under the hood, the Impact analysis workbook relies on the [Pearson correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient). Results are computed between -1 and 1 with -1 representing a negative linear correlation and 1 representing a positive linear correlation.

The basic breakdown of how Impact Analysis works is as follows:

Let _A_ = the main page view/custom event/request you select in the first dropdown. (**Selected event**).

Let _B_ = the secondary page view/custom event you select (**impacts the usage of**).

Impact looks at a sample of all the sessions from users in the selected time range. For each session, it looks for each occurrence of _A_.

Sessions are then broken into two different kinds of _subsessions_ based on one of two conditions:

- A converted subsession consists of a session ending with a _B_ event and encompasses all _A_ events that occur prior to _B_.
- An unconverted subsession occurs when all _A_'s occur without a terminal _B_.

How Impact is ultimately calculated varies based on whether we are analyzing by metric or by dimension. For metrics all _A_'s in a subsession are averaged. Whereas for dimensions the value of each _A_ contributes _1/N_ to the value assigned to _B_ where _N_ is the number of _A_'s in the subsession.

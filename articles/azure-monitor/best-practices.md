# Azure Monitor best practices
This scenario provides recommended guidance for configuring features of Azure Monitor to monitor the performance and availability of your cloud and hybrid applications and resources. 

Azure Monitor is available the moment you create an Azure subscription. The Activity log immediately starts collecting events about activity in the subscription, and platform metrics are collected for any Azure resources you created. Features such as metrics explorer are available to analyze data. Other features require configuration. This scenario identifies the configuration steps required to take advantage of all Azure Monitor features. It also makes recommendations for which features you should leverage and how to determine configuration options based on your particular requirements.

Enabling Azure Monitor to monitor of all your Azure resources is a combination of configuring Azure Monitor components and configuring Azure resources to generate monitoring data for Azure Monitor to collect. The goal of a complete implementation is to collect all useful data from all of your cloud resources and applications and enable the entire set of Azure Monitor features based on that data.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're new to Azure Monitor or are focused on simply monitoring a single Azure resource, then you should start with the tutorial [Monitor Azure resources with Azure Monitor](essentials/monitor-azure-resource.md). The tutorial provides general concepts for Azure Monitor and guidance for monitoring a single Azure resource. This scenario provides recommendations for preparing your environment to leverage all features of Azure Monitor to monitoring your entire set of applications and resources together at scale.

## Scope of the scenario
The goal of this scenario is to walk you through the basic steps of a complete Azure Monitor implementation to ensure that you're taking full advantage of its features and maximizing the observability of your cloud and hybrid applications and resources. It focuses on configuration requirements and deployment options as opposed to actual configuration details. Links are provided to other content that provide the details for actually performing required configuration.

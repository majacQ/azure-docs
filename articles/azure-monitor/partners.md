## Datadog

![Datadog logo.](./media/partners/datadog.png)

Azure enables customers to migrate and modernize their applications to run in the cloud, in coordination with many partner solutions. One such partner is Datadog, which provides observability and security tools for users to understand the health and performance of their applications across hybrid and multiple-cloud environments. But configuring the necessary integrations often requires moving between the Azure portal and Datadog. This process adds complexity, takes time, and makes it difficult to troubleshoot if things aren't working.  

To reduce the burden of managing across multiple portals, Microsoft has worked with Datadog to create an integrated Datadog solution on the Azure cloud platform. Available via Azure Marketplace, this solution provides a seamless experience for using the Datadog cloud monitoring solution in Azure.  

With the integration between Azure and Datadog, organizations can now fully map their legacy and cloud-based systems, monitor real-time data during every phase of the cloud transition, and help ensure that migrated applications meet performance targets. This integration combines the global presence, flexibility, security, and compliance capabilities of Azure with the logging and monitoring capabilities of Datadog. 

Through this unified experience, you'll be able to: 

- Provision a new Datadog organization and configure Azure resources to send logs and metrics to Datadog. This is a fully managed setup with no infrastructure for customers to set up and operate.  
- Seamlessly send logs and metrics to Datadog. The log-forwarding process has been completely automated. Rather than build out a log-forwarding pipeline with diagnostic settings, event hubs, and functions, you can configure everything with just a few clicks.
-	Easily install the Datadog agent on VM hosts through a single click.
-	Streamline single-sign on (SSO) to Datadog. A separate sign-on from the Datadog portal is no longer required. 
-	Get unified billing for the Datadog service through Azure subscription invoicing.

The [Datadog integration with Azure](../partner-solutions/datadog/overview.md) is available in [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/datadog1591740804488.dd_liftr_v2?tab=Overview). 

For documentation on the integration, see [Datadog integration with Azure](../partner-solutions/datadog/index.yml). If you're still using the previous, manually configured integration, see the [documentation on the Datadog website](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/azure/).

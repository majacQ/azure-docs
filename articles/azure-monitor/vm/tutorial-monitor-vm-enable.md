# Tutorial: Enable monitoring for Azure virtual machine
To monitor the health and performance of an Azure virtual machine, you need to install an agent to collect data from its guest operating system. VM insights is a feature of Azure Monitor for monitoring the guest operating system and workloads running on Azure virtual machines. When you enable monitoring for an Azure virtual machine, it installs the necessary agents and starts collecting performance, process, and dependency information from the guest operating system. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you're completely new to Azure Monitor, you should start with [Tutorial: Monitor Azure resources with Azure Monitor](../essentials/monitor-azure-resource.md). Azure virtual machines generate similar monitoring data as other Azure resources such as platform metrics and Activity log. This tutorial describes how to enable additional monitoring unique to virtual machines.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a Log Analytics workspace to collect performance and log data from the virtual machine.
> * Enable VM insights for the virtual machine which installs the required agents and begins data collection. 
> * Inspect graphs analyzing performance data collected form the virtual machine. 
> * Inspect map showing processes running on the virtual machine and dependencies with other systems.


> [!NOTE]
> VM insights installs the Log Analytics agent which collects performance data from the guest operating system of virtual machines. It doesn't collect logs from the guest operating system and doesn't send performance data to Azure Monitor Metrics. For this functionality, see [Tutorial: Collect guest logs and metrics from Azure virtual machine](tutorial-monitor-vm-guest.md).

## Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial you need the following: 

- An Azure virtual machine to monitor.



## Create a Log Analytics workspace
[!INCLUDE [Create workspace](../../../includes/azure-monitor-tutorial-workspace.md)]


## Enable monitoring
Select **Insights** from your virtual machine's menu in the Azure portal. If VM insights hasn't yet been enabled for it, you should see a screen similar to the following allowing you to enable monitoring. Click **Enable**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you selected the option to **Enable detailed monitoring** when you created your virtual machine, VM insights may already be enabled. Select your workspace and click **Enable** again. This is the workspace where data collected by VM insights will be sent.

You'll see a message saying that monitoring is being enabled. It may take several minutes for the agent to be installed and for data collection to begin. 

> [!NOTE]
> You may receive a message about an upgrade being available for VM insights. If so, select the option to perform the upgrade before proceeding.

## View performance
When the deployment is complete, you'll see views in the **Performance** tab in VM insights with performance data for the machine. This shows you the values of key guest metrics over time.

## View processes and dependencies
Select the **Maps** tab to view processes and dependencies for the virtual machine. The current machine is at the center of the view. View the processes running on it by expanding **Processes**.

## View machine details
The **Maps** view provides different tabs with information collected about the virtual machine. Click through the tabs to see what's available.

## Next steps
Now that you're collecting data from the virtual machine, you can use that data to create alerts to proactively notify you when issues are detected.

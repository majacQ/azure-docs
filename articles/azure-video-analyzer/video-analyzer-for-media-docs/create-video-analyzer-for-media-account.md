# Get started with Azure Video Analyzer for Media in Azure portal

This Quickstart walks you through the steps to get started with Azure Video Analyzer for Media. You will create an Azure Video Analyzer for Media account and its accompanying resources by using the Azure portal.

To start using Azure Video Analyzer for Media, you will need to create a Video Analyzer for Media account. The account needs to be associated with a [Media Services][docs-ms] resource and a [User-assigned managed identity][docs-uami]. The managed identity will need to have Contributor permissions role on the Media Services.

## Prerequisites

If you don't have the right permissions, ask your account administrator to grant you those permissions. The associated Azure Media Services must be in the same region as the Video Analyzer for Media account.

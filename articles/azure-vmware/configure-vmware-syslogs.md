# Configure VMware syslogs for Azure VMware Solution

Diagnostic settings are used to configure streaming export of platform logs and metrics for a resource to the destination of your choice. You can create up to five different diagnostic settings to send different logs and metrics to independent destinations. 

In this article, you'll configure a diagnostic setting to collect VMware syslogs for your Azure VMware Solution private cloud. You'll store the syslog to a storage account to view the vCenter logs and analyze for diagnostic purposes. 

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have an Azure VMware Solution private cloud with access to the vCenter and NSX-T Manager interfaces. 

## Configure diagnostic settings

1. From your Azure VMware Solution private cloud, select **Diagnostic settings**, then **Add diagnostic settings**.

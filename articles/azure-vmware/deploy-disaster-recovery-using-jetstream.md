# Deploy disaster recovery using JetStream DR


[JetStream DR](https://www.jetstreamsoft.com/product-portfolio/jetstream-dr/) is a cloud-native disaster recovery solution designed to minimize downtime of virtual machines (VMs) if there was a disaster. Instances of JetStream DR are deployed at both the protected and recovery sites. 

JetStream is built on the foundation of Continuous Data Protection (CDP), using [VMware VAIO framework](https://core.vmware.com/resource/vmware-vsphere-apis-io-filtering-vaio), which enables minimal or close to no data loss. JetStream DR provides the level of protection wanted for business and mission-critical applications. It also enables cost-effective DR by using minimal resources at the DR site and using cost-effective cloud storage, such as [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs/).

In this article, you'll implement JetStream DR for your Azure VMware Solution private cloud and on-premises VMware workloads.

## Core components of the JetStream DR solution

| Items | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **JetStream Management Server Virtual Appliance (MSA)**  | MSA enables both Day 0 and Day 2 configuration, such as primary sites, protection domains, and recovering VMs.  MSA is installed on a vSphere node by the cloud admin.  The MSA implements a vCenter plugin that allows you to manage JetStream DR natively from vCenter. The MSA doesn't handle replication data of protected VMs.  | 
| **JetStream DR Virtual Appliance (DRVA)**  | Linux-based Virtual Machine appliance receives protected VMs replication data from the source ESXi host. It's responsible for storing the replication data at the DR site, typically in an object store such as Azure Blob Storage. Depending on the number of protected VMs and the amount of storage to replicate, the private cloudadmin can create one or more DRVA instances.  | 
| **JetStream ESXi host components (IO Filter packages)**  | JetStream software installed on each ESXi host configured for JetStream DR. The host driver intercepts a vSphere VMs IO and sends the replication data to the DRVA.   | 
| **JetStream protection domain**  | Logical group of VMs that will be protected together using the same policies and run book. The data for all VMs in a protection domain is stored in the same Azure Blob container instance. The same DRVA instance handles replication to remote DR storage for all VMs in a protection domain.   | 
| **Azure Blob Storage containers**  | The protected VMs replicated data is stored in Azure Blobs. JetStream software creates one Azure Blob container instance for each JetStream protection domain.    | 



## JetStream scenarios on Azure VMware Solution
You can use JetStream DR with Azure VMware Solution for the following two scenarios:  

- On-premises VMware to Azure VMware Solution DR

- Azure VMware Solution to Azure VMware Solution DR

### Scenario 1: On-premises VMware to Azure VMware Solution DR

In this scenario, the primary site is your on-premises VMware environment and the DR site is an Azure VMware Solution private cloud.

### Scenario 2: Azure VMware Solution to Azure VMware Solution DR

In this scenario, the primary site is an Azure VMware Solution private cloud in one Azure region. The disaster recovery site is an Azure VMware Solution private cloud in a different Azure region.

## Install JetStream DR on Azure VMware Solution  
 
You can follow these steps for both supported scenarios. 
 
1. In your on-premises data center, install JetStream DR following the [JetStream documentation](https://www.jetstreamsoft.com/portal/jetstream-knowledge-base/installing-jetstream-dr-software/).  

1. In your Azure VMware Solution private cloud, install JetStream DR using a Run command. From the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Run command** > **Packages** > **JSDR.Configuration**.  

   :::image type="content" source="media/run-command/run-command-overview-jetstream.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to access the JetStream run commands available." lightbox="media/run-command/run-command-overview-jetstream.png":::
 
   >[!NOTE]
   >The default CloudAdmin user in Azure VMware Solution doesn't have sufficient privileges to install JetStream DR.  Azure VMware Solution enables simplified and automated installation of JetStream DR by invoking the Azure VMware Solution Run command for JetStream DR.  
 

1. Run the **Invoke-PreflightJetDRInstall** cmdlet, which checks if the prerequisites for installing JetStream DR have been met. For example, it validates the required number of hosts, cluster names, and unique VM names. 

1. Provide the required values or change the default values, and then select **Run**.

   | **Field** | **Value** |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Network**  | Name of the NSX-T network segment where you must deploy the JetStream MSA.  |
   | **Datastore**  | Name of the datastore where you'll deploy the MSA.  |

## Configure JetStream DR 
 
This section only covers an overview of the steps required for configuring JetStream DR.  For detailed descriptions and steps, see the [Configuring JetStream DR](https://www.jetstreamsoft.com/portal/jetstream-knowledge-base/configuring-jetstream-dr/) documentation. 
 
Once JetStream DR MSA and JetStream VIB are installed on the Azure VMware Solution clusters, use the JetStream portal to complete the remaining configuration steps. 



1. Access the JetStream portal from the vCenter appliance.

1. [Add an external storage site](https://www.jetstreamsoft.com/portal/jetstream-knowledge-base/add-a-storage-site/).  

1. [Deploy a JetStream DRVA appliance](https://www.jetstreamsoft.com/portal/jetstream-knowledge-base/deploy-a-dr-virtual-appliance/). 

1. [Create a JetStream replication log store volume](https://www.jetstreamsoft.com/portal/jetstream-knowledge-base/create-a-replication-log-store-volume/) using one of the datastores available to the Azure VMware Solution cluster. 

   >[!TIP]
   >Fast local storage, such as vSAN datastore, is preferred for the replication log. 
 
1. [Create a JetStream protected domain](https://www.jetstreamsoft.com/portal/jetstream-knowledge-base/create-a-protected-domain/). You'll provide the Azure Blob Storage site, JetStream DRVA instance, and replication log created in previous steps. 

1. [Select the VMs](https://www.jetstreamsoft.com/portal/jetstream-knowledge-base/select-vms-for-protection/) you want to protect and then [start VM protection](https://www.jetstreamsoft.com/portal/jetstream-knowledge-base/start-vm-protection/).

 
For remaining configuration steps for JetStream DR, such as creating a failover runbook, invoking failover to the DR site, and invoking failback to the primary site, see the [JetStream Admin Guide documentation](https://www.jetstreamsoft.com/portal/jetstream-article-categories/product-manual/).  
 
## Disable JetStream DR on an Azure VMware Solution cluster

# Upgrade a SKU

This article helps you upgrade from the Basic Tier (SKU) to Standard. Once you upgrade, you can't revert back to the Basic SKU without deleting and reconfiguring Bastion. Currently, this setting can be configured in the Azure portal only. For more information about host scaling, see [Configuration settings- SKUs](configuration-settings.md#skus). 

## Configuration steps

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com).
1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your Bastion host.
1. On the **Configuration** page, for **Tier**, select **Standard** from the dropdown.

1. Click **Apply** to apply changes.

## Next steps

Speech SDK can use [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org) to handle compressed audio. However, for licensing reasons GStreamer binaries are not compiled and linked with the Speech SDK. Developers need to install several dependencies and plugins, see [Installing on Linux](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/on-linux.html?gi-language=c). Go language is only supported in Speech SDK on the Linux platform. See [Speech SDK for Go](../../../../quickstarts/setup-platform.md?pivots=programming-language-go&tabs=dotnet%252cwindows%252cjre%252cbrowser) to get started with Microsoft Speech SDK in Go.

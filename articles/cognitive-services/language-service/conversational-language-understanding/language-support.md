# Conversational Language Understanding language support 

Use this article to learn which natural languages are supported by the Conversational Language Understanding feature.

The supported languages for conversation projects are:

| **Language** | **Language Code** |
| --- | --- |
| Brazilian Portuguese | `pt-br` |
| Chinese | `zh-cn` |

#### Multilingual conversation projects

The quality of predictions may vary between languages â€“ and certain language groups work better than others with respect to multilingual predictions.

### Create a new resource from the Azure portal

Go to the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics) to create a new Azure Language resource. If you're asked to select additional features, select **Skip this step**. When you create your resource, ensure it has the following parameters.  

|Requirement  |Required value  |
|---------|---------|
|Location | "West US 2" or "West Europe"         |
|Pricing tier     | Standard (**S**) pricing tier        |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the **Custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) & Custom Classification (Preview)** section, make sure you choose an existing storage account, or create a new one. A storage account is required to use custom text classification. While you can specify a storage account later, it's easier to do it now.

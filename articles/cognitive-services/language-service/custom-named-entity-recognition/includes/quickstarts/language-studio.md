## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)

## Create a new Azure resource and Azure Blob Storage account

Before you can use custom NER, you will need to create an Azure Language resource, which will give you the credentials needed to create a project and start training a model. You will also need an Azure storage account, where you can upload your dataset that will be used to building your model.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To get started quickly, we recommend creating a new Azure Language resource using the steps provided below, which will let you create the resource, and configure a storage account at the same time, which is easier than doing it later.
>
> If you have a pre-existing resource you'd like to use, you will need to configure it and a storage account separately. See [create project](../../how-to/create-project.md#using-a-pre-existing-azure-resource)  for information.

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics) to create a new Azure Language resource. If you're asked to select additional features, select **Custom text classification & custom NER**. When you create your resource, ensure it has the following parameters.

    |Azure resource requirement  |Required value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |Location | "West US 2" or "West Europe"         |
    |Pricing tier     | Standard (**S**) pricing tier        |

2. In the **Custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) & Custom Classification (Preview)** section, select an existing storage account or select **Create a new storage account**. Note that these values are for this quickstart, and not necessarily the [storage account values](../../../../../storage/common/storage-account-overview.md) you will want to use in production environments.

    |Storage account value  |Recommended value  |
    |---------|---------|
    | Name | Any name |
    | Performance | Standard |
    | Account kind| Storage (general purpose v1) |
    | Replication | Locally-redundant storage (LRS)
    |Location | Any location closest to you, for best latency.        |

## Upload sample data to blob container

After you have created an Azure storage account and linked it to your Language resource, you will need to upload the example files for this quickstart. These files will later be used to train your model.

1. [Download the example data](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2175226) for this quickstart from GitHub.

2. Go to your Azure storage account in the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com). Navigate to your account, and upload the sample data to it.

The provided sample dataset contains 20 loan agreements, each agreement includes two parties: a lender and a borrower. You can use the provided sample file to extract relevant information for both parties, an agreement date, a loan amount, and an interest rate.

## Create a custom named entity recognition project

Once your resource and storage container are configured, create a new conversational NER project. A project is a work area for building your custom AI models based on your data. Your project can only be accessed by you and others who have contributor access to the Azure resource being used.

1. Sign into the [Language Studio portal](https://aka.ms/languageStudio). A window will appear to let you select your subscription and Language resource. Select the resource you created in the above step.

2. Find the **Entity extraction** section, and select **Custom named entity recognition** from the available services.

3. Select **Create new project** from the top menu in your projects page. Creating a project will let you tag data, train, evaluate, improve, and deploy your models. 

    
    :::image type="content" source="../../media/create-project.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the project creation page." lightbox="../../media/create-project.png":::


4.  After you click, **Create new project**, a screen will appear to let you connect your storage account. If you cannot find your storage account, make sure you created a resource using the steps above. 

    >[!NOTE]
    > * You only need to do this step once for each new resource you use. 
    > * This process is irreversible, if you connect a storage account to your resource you cannot disconnect it later.
    > * You can only connect your resource to one storage account.
    > * If you've already connected a storage account, you will see a **Enter basic information** screen instead. See the next step.

<!--If you're using a preexisting resource, see [creating Azure resources](../concepts/use-azure-resources.md). When you are done, select **Next**.--> 

5. Enter the project information, including a name, description, and the language of the files in your project. You will not be able to change the name of your project later. 

6. Select the container where you have uploaded your data. For this quickstart, we will use the existing tags file available in the container. Then click **Next**.

7. Review the data you entered and select **Create Project**.

## Train your model

Typically after you create a project, you would import your data and begin [tagging the entities](../../how-to/tag-data.md) within it to train the classification model. For this quickstart, you will use the example tagged data file you downloaded earlier, and stored in your Azure storage account.

A model is the machine learning object that will be trained to classify text. Your model will learn from the example data, and be able to classify technical support tickets afterwards.

To start training your model:

1. Select **Train** from the left side menu.

2. Select **Train a new model** and type in the model name in the text box below.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/train-model.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the model selection page for training" lightbox="../../media/train-model.png":::

3. Click on the **Train** button at the bottom of the page.

    > [!NOTE]
    > * While training, the data will be spilt into 2 sets: 80% for training and 20% for testing. You can learn more about data splitting [here](../../how-to/train-model.md#data-split)
    > * Training can take up to a few hours.

## Deploy your model

Generally after training a model you would review it's [evaluation details](../../how-to/view-model-evaluation.md) and [make improvements](../../how-to/improve-model.md) if necessary. In this quickstart, you will just deploy your model, and make it available for you to try.

After your model is trained, you can deploy it. Deploying your model lets you start using it to extract named entities, using [Analyze API](https://aka.ms/ct-runtime-swagger).

1. Select **Deploy model** from the left side menu.

2. Select the model you want to deploy, then select **Deploy model**.

## Test your model

After your model is deployed, you can start using it for entity extraction. Use the following steps to send your first entity extraction request.

1. Select **Test model** from the left side menu.

2. Select the model you want to test.

3. Add your text to the textbox, you can also upload a `.txt` file. 

4. Click on **Run the test**.

5. In the **Result** tab, you can see the extracted entities from your text and their types. You can also view the JSON response under the **JSON** tab.

## Clean up resources

When you don't need your project anymore, you can delete your project using [Language Studio](https://aka.ms/custom-extraction). Select **Custom Named Entity Recognition (NER)** in the left navigation menu, select project you want to delete and click on **Delete**.

# Language support for Language Detection

Use this article to learn which natural languages are supported by Language Detection.


> [!NOTE]
> Languages are added as new [model versions](how-to/call-api.md#specify-the-language-detection-model) are released. The current model version for Language Detection is `2021-01-05`.

The Language Detection feature can detect a wide range of languages, variants, dialects, and some regional/cultural languages, and return detected languages with their name and code. The returned language code parameters conform to [BCP-47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) standard with most of them conforming to [ISO-639-1](https://www.iso.org/iso-639-language-codes.html) identifiers. 

If you have content expressed in a less frequently used language, you can try Language Detection to see if it returns a code. The response for languages that cannot be detected is `unknown`.

# Supported Text Analytics for health entity categories

Text Analytics for health processes and extracts insights from unstructured medical data. The service detects and surfaces medical concepts, assigns assertions to concepts, infers semantic relations between concepts and links them to common medical ontologies.

Text Analytics for health detects medical concepts in the following categories.

## Anatomy

### Entities

**BODY_STRUCTURE** - Body systems, anatomic locations or regions, and body sites. For example, arm, knee, abdomen, nose, liver, head, respiratory system, lymphocytes.

## Supported Assertions

Assertion modifiers are divided into three categories, each one focuses on a different aspect.
Each category contains a set of mutually exclusive values. Only one value per category is assigned to each entity. The most common value for each category is the Default value. The service’s output response contains only assertion modifiers that are different from the default value.

### Certainty  

provides information regarding the presence (present vs. absent) of the concept and how certain the text is regarding its presence (definite vs. possible).

**Positive** (Default): the concept exists or happened.

**Negative**: the concept does not exist now or never happened.

:::image type="content" source="../media/entities/negative-entity.png" alt-text="An example of a negative entity." lightbox="../media/entities/negative-entity.png":::

**Positive_Possible**: the concept likely exists but there is some uncertainty.

:::image type="content" source="../media/entities/positive-possible-entity.png" alt-text="An example of a positive possible entity." lightbox="../media/entities/positive-possible-entity.png" :::

**Negative_Possible**: the concept’s existence is unlikely but there is some uncertainty.

:::image type="content" source="../media/entities/negative-possible-entity.png" alt-text="An example of a negative possible entity." lightbox="../media/entities/negative-possible-entity.png" :::

**Neutral_Possible**: the concept may or may not exist without a tendency to either side.

:::image type="content" source="../media/entities/neutral-possible-entity.png" alt-text="An example of a neutral possible entity." lightbox="../media/entities/neutral-possible-entity.png":::

### Conditionality

provides information regarding whether the existence of a concept depends on certain conditions. 

**None** (Default): the concept is a fact and not hypothetical and does not depend on certain conditions.

**Hypothetical**: the concept may develop or occur in the future.

:::image type="content" source="../media/entities/hypothetical-entity.png" alt-text="An example of a hypothetical entity." lightbox="../media/entities/hypothetical-entity.png":::

**Conditional**: the concept exists or occurs only under certain conditions.

:::image type="content" source="../media/entities/conditional-entity.png" alt-text="An example of a conditional entity." lightbox="../media/entities/conditional-entity.png":::

### Association

describes whether the concept is associated with the subject of the text or someone else.

**Subject** (Default): the concept is associated with the subject of the text, usually the patient.

**Someone_Else**: the concept is associated with someone who is not the subject of the text.

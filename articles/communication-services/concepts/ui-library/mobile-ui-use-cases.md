# UI Library (iOS and Android) capabilities

[!INCLUDE [Public Preview Notice](../../includes/private-preview-include.md)]

UI Library for iOS and Android supports calling use cases by using the **calling composite**.
Composites enable developers to easily integrate a whole calling experience into their application with only a couple of lines of code; those composites take care of the entire lifecycle of the call from setup to the call ending.

## Calling

## Supported Identities

An Azure Communication Services identity is required to initialize the composites and authenticate to the service.
For more information on authentication, see [Authentication](../authentication.md) and [Access Tokens](../../quickstarts/access-tokens.md)

## Teams Interop

![Teams Interop pattern for calling and chat](../media/mobile-ui/teams-interop-diagram.png)

For [Teams Interop](../teams-interop.md) scenarios, developers can use the UI Mobile Library Components to join Teams meetings through Azure Communication Services.
To enable Teams Interop, developers can use the calling composite, which will take care of the lifecycle of joining a Teams Interop call.

## Theming

The UI Library Calling Composite for iOS and Android provides interfaces for developers change the theme of the experience by passing in a primary color. The Composite uses that primary color to provide appropriate theming across the experience.

| Android                            | iOS                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| :::image type="content" source="../media/mobile-ui/android-color.png" alt-text="android theming"::: | :::image type="content" source="../media/mobile-ui/ios-dark.png" alt-text="iOS theming":::  |


## Screen size

The calling composite offers to adapt to any screen size that would bring support from 5" screens to tablets, get the dynamic participants' roster layout, provide clarity on the view, and focus on the conversation.

|Split mode | Tablet mode|
|---------|---------|
| :::image type="content" source="../media/mobile-ui/meet-splitscreen.png" alt-text="split screen"::: |  :::image type="content" source="../media/mobile-ui/tablet-landscape.png" alt-text="tablet mode"::: |

## Recommended Architecture

Composites are initialized using an Azure Communication Services access token. Access tokens should be procured from Azure Communication Services through a
trusted service that you manage. See [Quickstart: Create Access Tokens](../../quickstarts/access-tokens.md) and [Trusted Service Tutorial](../../tutorials/trusted-service-tutorial.md) for more information.

These client libraries also require the context for the call they will join. Similar to user access tokens, this context should be disseminated to clients via your own trusted service. The list below summarizes the initialization and resource management functions that you need to operationalize.

| Contoso Responsibilities                                 | UI Library Responsibilities                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Provide access token from Azure                          | Pass through given access token to initialize components        |
| Provide refresh function                                 | Refresh access token using developer provided function          |
| Retrieve/Pass join information for call or chat          | Pass through call and chat information to initialize components |
| Retrieve/Pass user information for any custom data model | Pass through custom data model to components to render          |

## Platform support

|Platform | Versions|
|---------|---------|
| iOS     | iOS 13+ |
| Android | v23+    |

## Accessibility

- Accessibility by design is a principle across Microsoft products.
- UI Library follows this principle in making sure that all UI Components are fully accessible.
- During public preview, the UI Library will continue to improve and add accessibility feature to the UI Components.

## Localization

- Localization is a key to making products that can be used across the world and by people who speak different languages.
- UI Library will provide out of the box support for some languages and capabilities such as RTL.
- Developers can provide their own localization files to be used for the UI Library.

# Quickstart: Create and manage access tokens

Access tokens let ACS SDKs [authenticate](../concepts/authentication.md) directly against Azure Communication Services as a particular identity. You'll need to create some if you want your users to join a call or chat thread within your application. 

You can also use the ACS SDKs to create identities and manage your access tokens and in this quickstart we'll be learning how to do this. For production use cases we recommend generating access tokens on a [server-side service](../concepts/client-and-server-architecture.md).

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Communication Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it. Learn more about [cleaning up resources](./create-communication-resource.md#clean-up-resources).

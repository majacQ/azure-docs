# Quickstart: Submit a job for queuing and routing

[!INCLUDE [Private Preview Disclaimer](../../includes/private-preview-include-section.md)]

Get started with Azure Communication Services Job Router by setting up your client. Then can configure core functionality such as queues, policies, workers, and Jobs. To learn more about Job Router concepts, visit [Job Router conceptual documentation](../../concepts/router/concepts.md)

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- An active Communication Services resource and connection string. [Create a Communication Services resource](../create-communication-resource.md).

## Setting up

### Create a new C# application

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), use the `dotnet new` command to create a new console app with the name `JobRouterQuickstart`. This command creates a simple "Hello World" C# project with a single source file: **Program.cs**.

```console
dotnet new console -o JobRouterQuickstart
```

Change your directory to the newly created app folder and use the `dotnet build` command to compile your application.

```console
cd JobRouterQuickstart
dotnet build
```

### Install the package

During private preview, please download the SDK from [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/communication-preview/releases/tag/communication-job-router-net-v1.0.0-alpha.20211012.1).

> [!NOTE]
> You must be a member of the private preview group to download the SDKs.

Add the following `using` directives to the top of **Program.cs** to include the JobRouter namespaces.

```csharp
using Azure.Communication.JobRouter;
```

Update `Main` function signature to be `async` and return a `Task`.

```csharp
static async Task Main(string[] args)
{
  ...
}
```

## Authenticate the Job Router client

Job Router clients can be authenticated using your connection string acquired from an Azure Communication Services resource in the Azure portal.

```csharp
// Get a connection string to our Azure Communication Services resource.
var connectionString = "your_connection_string";
var client = new RouterClient(connectionString);
```

## Create a distribution policy

Job Router uses a distribution policy to decide how Workers will be notified of available Jobs and the time to live for the notifications, known as **Offers**. Create the policy by specifying the **ID**, a **name**, an **offerTTL**, and a distribution **mode**.

```csharp
var distributionPolicy = await client.SetDistributionPolicyAsync(
    id: "Longest_Idle_45s_Min1Max10",
    name: "Longest Idle matching with a 45s offer expiration; min 1, max 10 offers",
    offerTTL: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(45),
    mode: new LongestIdleMode(
        minConcurrentOffers: 1,
        maxConcurrentOffers: 10)
);
```

## Create a queue

Jobs are organized into a logical Queue. Create the Queue by specifying an **ID**, **name**, and provide the **Distribution Policy** object's ID you created above.

```csharp
var queue = await client.SetQueueAsync(
    id: "XBOX_Queue",
    name: "XBOX Queue",
    distributionPolicyId: distributionPolicy.Value.Id
);
```

## Submit a job
The quickest way to get started is to specify the ID of the Queue, the priority, and worker requirements when submitting a Job. In the example below, a Job will be submitted directly to the **XBOX Queue** where the workers in that queue require a `Location` label matching the name `Edmonton`.

```csharp
var job = await client.CreateJobAsync(
    channelId: ManagedChannels.AcsChatChannel,
    channelReference: "12345",
    queueId: queue.Value.Id,
    priority: 1,
    workerSelector: new List<LabelSelector>
    {
        new (
            key: "Location", 
            @operator: LabelOperator.Equal, 
            value: "Edmonton")
    });
```

## Register a worker
Register a Worker by referencing the Queue ID created previously along with a **capacity** value, **labels**, and **channel configuration** to ensure the `EdmontonWorker` is assigned to the `XBOX_Queue'.

```csharp
var edmontonWorker = await client.RegisterWorkerAsync(
    id: "EdmontonWorker",
    queueIds: new []{ queue.Value.Id },
    totalCapacity: 100,
    labels: new LabelCollection()
    {
        {"Location", "Edmonton"}
    },
    channelConfigurations: new List<ChannelConfiguration>
    {
        new (
            channelId: ManagedChannels.AcsVoiceChannel,
            capacityCostPerJob: 100)
    }
);
```

## Query the worker to observe the job offer
Use the Job Router client connection to query the Worker and observe the ID of the Job against the ID 

```csharp
    // wait 500ms for the Job Router to offer the Job to the Worker
    Task.Delay(500).Wait();

    var result = await client.GetWorkerAsync(edmontonWorker.Value.Id);

    Console.WriteLine(
        $"Job ID: {job.Value.Id} offered to {edmontonWorker.Value.Id} " +
        $"should match Job ID attached to worker: {result.}");
```

Run the application using `dotnet run` and observe the results.

```console
dotnet run

Job 6b83c5ad-5a92-4aa8-b986-3989c791be91 offered to EdmontonWorker should match Job ID from offer attached to worker: 6b83c5ad-5a92-4aa8-b986-3989c791be91
```

> [!NOTE]
> Running the application more than once will cause a new Job to be placed in the queue each time. This can cause the Worker to be offered a Job other than the one created when you run the above code. Since this can skew your request, considering removing Jobs in the queue each time. Refer to the SDK documentation for managing a Queue or a Job.

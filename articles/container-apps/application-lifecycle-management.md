# Application lifecycle management in Azure Container Apps Preview

The Azure Container Apps application lifecycle revolves around [revisions](revisions.md).

When you deploy a container app, the first revision is automatically created. [More revisions are created](revisions.md) as [containers](containers.md) change, or any adjustments are made to the `template` section of the configuration.

A container app flows through three phases: deployment, update, and deactivation.

## Deployment

As a container app is deployed, the first revision is automatically created.

## Update

As a container app is updated with a [revision scope-change](revisions.md#revision-scope-changes), a new revision is created. You can choose whether to [automatically deactivate new old revisions, or allow them to remain available](revisions.md).

## Deactivate

Once a revision is no longer needed, you can deactivate a revision with the option to reactivate later. During deactivation, the container is [shut down](#shutdown).

## Shutdown

The containers are shut down in the following situations:

- As a container app scales in
- As a container app is being deleted
- As a revision is being deactivated

When a shutdown is initiated, the container host sends a [SIGTERM message](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(IPC)) to your container. The code implemented in the container can respond to this operating system-level message to handle termination.

If your application does not respond to the `SIGTERM` message, then [SIGKILL](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(IPC)) terminates your container.

# Connect applications in Azure Container Apps Preview

Azure Container Apps exposes each container app through a domain name if [ingress](ingress.md) is enabled. Ingress endpoints can be exposed either publicly to the world or internally and only available to other container apps in the same [environment](environment.md).

Once you know a container app's domain name, then you can call the location within your application code to connect multiple container apps together.

> [!NOTE]
> When you call another container in the same environment using the FQDN, the network traffic never leaves the environment.

A sample solution showing how you can call between containers using both the FQDN Location or Dapr can be found on [Azure Samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/container-apps-connect-multiple-apps)

## Location

A container app's location is composed of values associated with its environment, name, and region. Available through the `azurecontainerapps.io` top-level domain, the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) uses:

- the container app name
- the environment unique identifier
- region name

The following diagram shows how these values are used to compose a container app's fully qualified domain name.

## Dapr location

Developing microservices often requires you to implement patterns common to distributed architecture. Dapr allows you to secure microservices with mutual TLS, trigger retries when errors occur, and take advantage of distributed tracing when Azure Application Insights is enabled.

A microservice that uses Dapr is available through the following URL pattern:

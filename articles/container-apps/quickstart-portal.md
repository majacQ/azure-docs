# Quickstart: Deploy your first container app using the Azure portal

Azure Container Apps Preview enables you to run microservices and containerized applications on a serverless platform. With Container Apps, you enjoy the benefits of running containers while leaving behind the concerns of manually configuring cloud infrastructure and complex container orchestrators.

In this quickstart, you create a secure Container Apps environment and deploy your first container app using the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

An Azure account with an active subscription is required. If you don't already have one, you can [create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

## Setup

Begin by signing in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

# Troubleshoot issues with advanced diagnostics queries for the MongoDB API

In this article, we'll cover how to write more advanced queries to help troubleshoot issues with your Azure Cosmos DB account by using diagnostics logs sent to **Azure Diagnostics (legacy)** and **resource-specific (preview)** tables.

For Azure Diagnostics tables, all data is written into one single table. Users specify which category they want to query. If you want to view the full-text query of your request, see [Monitor Azure Cosmos DB data by using diagnostic settings in Azure](../cosmosdb-monitor-resource-logs.md#full-text-query) to learn how to enable this feature.

For [resource-specific tables](../cosmosdb-monitor-resource-logs.md#create-setting-portal), data is written into individual tables for each category of the resource. We recommend this mode because it:

- Makes it much easier to work with the data. 
- Provides better discoverability of the schemas.
- Improves performance across both ingestion latency and query times.

## Common queries
Common queries are shown in the resource-specific and Azure Diagnostics tables.

### Top N(10) Request Unit (RU) consuming requests or queries in a specific time frame

# [Resource-specific](#tab/resource-specific)
   ```Kusto
   //Enable full-text query to view entire query text
   CDBMongoRequests
   | where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
   | project PIICommandText, ActivityId, DatabaseName , CollectionName, RequestCharge
   | order by RequestCharge desc
   | take 10
   ```

# [Azure Diagnostics](#tab/azure-diagnostics)
   ```Kusto
   AzureDiagnostics
   | where Category == "MongoRequests"
   | where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
   | project piiCommandText_s, activityId_g, databaseName_s , collectionName_s, requestCharge_s
   | order by requestCharge_s desc
   | take 10
   ```    
---

### Requests throttled (statusCode = 429 or 16500) in a specific time window 

# [Resource-specific](#tab/resource-specific)
   ```Kusto
   CDBMongoRequests
   | where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
   | where ErrorCode == "429" or ErrorCode == "16500"
   | project DatabaseName, CollectionName, PIICommandText, OperationName, TimeGenerated
   ```

# [Azure Diagnostics](#tab/azure-diagnostics)
   ```Kusto
   AzureDiagnostics
   | where Category == "MongoRequests" and TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
   | where ErrorCode == "429" or ErrorCode == "16500"
   | project databaseName_s , collectionName_s , piiCommandText_s , OperationName, TimeGenerated
   ```    
---

### Timed-out requests (statusCode = 50) in a specific time window 

# [Resource-specific](#tab/resource-specific)
   ```Kusto
   CDBMongoRequests
   | where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
   | where ErrorCode == "50"
   | project DatabaseName, CollectionName, PIICommandText, OperationName, TimeGenerated
   ```
# [Azure Diagnostics](#tab/azure-diagnostics)
   ```Kusto
   AzureDiagnostics
   | where Category == "MongoRequests" and TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
   | where ErrorCode == "50"
   | project databaseName_s , collectionName_s , piiCommandText_s , OperationName, TimeGenerated
   ```    
---

### Queries with large response lengths (payload size of the server response)

# [Resource-specific](#tab/resource-specific)
   ```Kusto
   CDBMongoRequests
   //specify collection and database
   //| where DatabaseName == "DBNAME" and CollectionName == "COLLECTIONNAME"
   | summarize max(ResponseLength) by PIICommandText, RequestCharge, DurationMs, OperationName, TimeGenerated
   | order by max_ResponseLength desc
   ```
# [Azure Diagnostics](#tab/azure-diagnostics)
   ```Kusto
   AzureDiagnostics
   | where Category == "MongoRequests"
   //specify collection and database
   //| where databaseName_s == "DBNAME" and collectionName_s == "COLLECTIONNAME"
   | summarize max(responseLength_s) by piiCommandText_s, OperationName, duration_s, requestCharge_s
   | order by max_responseLength_s desc
   ```    
---

### RU consumption by physical partition (across all replicas in the replica set)

# [Resource-specific](#tab/resource-specific)
   ```Kusto
   CDBPartitionKeyRUConsumption
   | where TimeGenerated >= now(-1d)
   //specify collection and database
   //| where DatabaseName == "DBNAME" and CollectionName == "COLLECTIONNAME"
   // filter by operation type
   //| where operationType_s == 'Create'
   | summarize sum(todouble(RequestCharge)) by toint(PartitionKeyRangeId)
   | render columnchart
   ```

# [Azure Diagnostics](#tab/azure-diagnostics)
   ```Kusto
   AzureDiagnostics
   | where TimeGenerated >= now(-1d)
   | where Category == 'PartitionKeyRUConsumption'
   //specify collection and database
   //| where databaseName_s == "DBNAME" and collectionName_s == "COLLECTIONNAME"
   // filter by operation type
   //| where operationType_s == 'Create'
   | summarize sum(todouble(requestCharge_s)) by toint(partitionKeyRangeId_s)
   | render columnchart  
   ```    
---

### RU consumption by logical partition (across all replicas in the replica set)

# [Resource-specific](#tab/resource-specific)
   ```Kusto
   CDBPartitionKeyRUConsumption
   | where TimeGenerated >= now(-1d)
   //specify collection and database
   //| where DatabaseName == "DBNAME" and CollectionName == "COLLECTIONNAME"
   // filter by operation type
   //| where operationType_s == 'Create'
   | summarize sum(todouble(RequestCharge)) by PartitionKey, PartitionKeyRangeId
   | render columnchart  
   ```
# [Azure Diagnostics](#tab/azure-diagnostics)
   ```Kusto
   AzureDiagnostics
   | where TimeGenerated >= now(-1d)
   | where Category == 'PartitionKeyRUConsumption'
   //specify collection and database
   //| where databaseName_s == "DBNAME" and collectionName_s == "COLLECTIONNAME"
   // filter by operation type
   //| where operationType_s == 'Create'
   | summarize sum(todouble(requestCharge_s)) by partitionKey_s, partitionKeyRangeId_s
   | render columnchart  
   ```

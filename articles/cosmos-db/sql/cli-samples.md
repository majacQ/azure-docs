# Azure CLI samples for Azure Cosmos DB Core (SQL) API
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sql-api](../includes/appliesto-sql-api.md)]

The following table includes links to sample Azure CLI scripts for Azure Cosmos DB. Use the links on the right to navigate to API-specific samples. Common samples are the same across all APIs. Reference pages for all Azure Cosmos DB CLI commands are available in the [Azure CLI Reference](/cli/azure/cosmosdb). Azure Cosmos DB CLI script samples can also be found in the [Azure Cosmos DB CLI GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cli-samples/tree/master/cosmosdb).

These samples require Azure CLI version 2.30 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

For Azure CLI samples for other APIs see [CLI Samples for Cassandra](../cassandra/cli-samples.md), [CLI Samples for MongoDB API](../mongodb/cli-samples.md), [CLI Samples for Gremlin](../graph/cli-samples.md), [CLI Samples for Table](../table/cli-samples.md)

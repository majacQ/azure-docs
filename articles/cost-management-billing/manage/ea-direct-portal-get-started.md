## Understanding EA user roles and introduction to user hierarchy

To help manage your organization's usage and spend, Azure Enterprise Agreement (EA) administrators can assign the following distinct administrative roles:

- Enterprise Administrator
- Enterprise Administrator (read only)
- Department Administrator
- Department Administrator (read only)
- Account Owner

Each role has a varying degree of user limits and permissions. For more information, see [Organization structure and permissions by role](understand-ea-roles.md#organization-structure-and-permissions-by-role).

## Activate your enrollment, create a subscription, and other administrative tasks

For more information about activating your enrollment, creating a department or subscription, adding administrators and account owners, and other administrative tasks, see [Azure direct EA administration](direct-ea-administration.md).

If you’d like to know more about transferring an Enterprise subscription to a Pay-As-You-Go subscription, see [Azure Enterprise transfers](ea-transfers.md).

## View your enterprise department and account lists

If you’d like to view all the departments and accounts in your billing account, use the following steps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Navigate to **Cost Management + Billing**.
1. In the left menu, select **Billing scopes** and then select a billing account scope.
1. In the navigation menu, select **Department** or **Account** to view its details.

## View usage summary and download reports

You view a summary of your usage data, Azure Prepayment consumed, and charges associated with other usage in the Azure portal. Charges are presented at the summary level across all accounts and subscriptions of the enrollment.
To view a usage summary, price sheet, and download reports, see [Review usage charges](direct-ea-azure-usage-charges-invoices.md#review-usage-charges).

## View and download invoice

You view and download your Azure EA invoice in the Azure portal. It's a self-serve capability and an EA admin of an enrollment has access to manage invoices. Your invoice is a representation of your bill and should be reviewed for accuracy. For more information, see [Download or view your Azure billing invoice](direct-ea-azure-usage-charges-invoices.md#download-or-view-your-azure-billing-invoice).

## View Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC)

You view and track your Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC) in the Azure portal. If your organization has a MACC for an EA billing account, you can check important aspects of your commitment, including start and end dates, remaining commitment, and eligible spend in the Azure portal. For more information, see [MACC overview](track-consumption-commitment.md?tabs=portal.md#track-your-macc-commitment).

# Understanding pipeline failure

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

## Error handling

Azure Data Factory and Synapse Pipeline orchestration allows conditional logic and enables user to take different based upon outcomes of a previous activity. Using different paths allow users to build robust pipelines and incorporates error handling in ETL/ELT logic. In total, we allow four conditional paths,

* Upon Success (default pass)
* Upon Failure
* Upon Completion
* Upon Skip

### Common error handling mechanism

#### Try Catch block

In this approach, customer defines the business logic, and only defines the _Upon Failure_ path to catch any error from previous activity. This approach renders pipeline succeeds, if _Upon Failure_ path succeeds.

#### Do If Else block

In this approach, customer defines the business logic, and defines both the _Upon Failure_ and _Upon Success_ paths. This approach renders pipeline fails, even if _Upon Failure_ path succeeds.

#### Do If Skip Else block

In this approach, customer defines the business logic, and defines both the _Upon Failure_ path, and _Upon Success_ path, with a dummy _Upon Skipped_ activity attached. This approach renders pipeline succeeds, if _Upon Failure_ path succeeds.

### Summary table

Approach | Defines | When activity succeeds, overall pipeline shows | When activity fails, overall pipeline shows
---------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------
[Try-Catch](#try-catch-block) | Only _Upon Failure_ path | Success |  Success
[Do-If-Else](#do-if-else-block) | _Upon Failure_ path + _Upon Success_ paths | Success |  Failure
[Do-If-Skip-Else](#do-if-skip-else-block) |  _Upon Failure_ path + _Upon Success_ path (with a _Dummy Upon Skip_ at the end) | Success |  Success

### How pipeline failure are determined

Different error handling mechanisms will lead to different status for the pipeline: while some pipelines fail, others succeed. We determine pipeline success and failures as follows:

* Evaluate outcome for all leaves activities. If a leaf activity was skipped, we evaluate its parent activity instead
* Pipeline result is success if and only if all nodes evaluated succeed

Assuming _Upon Failure_ activity and _Dummy Upon Failure_ activity succeed,

* In [Try-Catch](#try-catch-block) approach,

  * When previous activity succeeds: node _Upon Failure_ is skipped and its parent node succeeds; overall pipeline succeeds
  * When previous activity fails: node _Upon Failure_ is enacted; overall pipeline succeeds

* In [Do-If-Else](#do-if-else-block) approach,

  * When previous activity succeeds: node _Upon Success_ succeeds and node _Upon Failure_ is skipped (and its parent node succeeds); overall pipeline succeeds
  * When previous activity fails: node _Upon Success_ is skipped and its parent node failed; overall pipeline fails

* In [Do-If-Skip-Else](#do-if-skip-else-block) approach,

  * When previous activity succeeds: node _Dummy Upon Skip_ is skipped and its parent node _Upon Success_ succeeds; the other node activity, _Upon Failure_, is skipped and its parent node succeeds; overall pipeline succeeds
  * When previous activity fails: node _Upon Failure_ succeeds and _Dummy Upon Skip_ succeeds; overall pipeline succeeds

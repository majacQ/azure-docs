# Introduction to Microsoft Defender for Storage

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](./includes/banner.md)]

**Microsoft Defender for Storage** is an Azure-native layer of security intelligence that detects unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit your storage accounts. It utilizes the advanced capabilities of security AI and [Microsoft Threat Intelligence](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2128684) to provide contextual security alerts and recommendations.

Security alerts are triggered when anomalous activities occur. These alerts appear in Microsoft Defender for Cloud, and are also sent via email to subscription administrators, with details of suspicious activity and recommendations for how to investigate and remediate threats.

## What are the benefits of Microsoft Defender for Storage?

Microsoft Defender for Storage provides:

- **Azure-native security** - With 1-click enablement, Defender for Storage protects data stored in Azure Blob, Azure Files, and Data Lakes. As an Azure-native service, Defender for Storage provides centralized security across all data assets managed by Azure and is integrated with other Azure security services such as Microsoft Sentinel.
- **Rich detection suite** - Powered by Microsoft Threat Intelligence, the detections in Defender for Storage cover the top storage threats such as anonymous access, compromised credentials, social engineering, privilege abuse, and malicious content.
- **Response at scale** - Defender for Cloud's automation tools make it easier to prevent and respond to identified threats. Learn more in [Automate responses to Defender for Cloud triggers](workflow-automation.md).

## What kind of alerts does Microsoft Defender for Storage provide?

Security alerts are triggered when there's:

- **Suspicious access patterns** - such as successful access from a Tor exit node or from an IP considered suspicious by Microsoft Threat Intelligence
- **Suspicious activities** - such as anomalous data extraction or unusual change of access permissions
- **Upload of malicious content** - such as potential malware files (based on hash reputation analysis) or hosting of phishing content

Alerts include details of the incident that triggered them, as well as recommendations on how to investigate and remediate threats. Alerts can be exported to Microsoft Sentinel or any other third-party SIEM or any other external tool.

> [!TIP]
> It's a best practice to [configure Microsoft Defender for Storage](../storage/common/azure-defender-storage-configure.md?tabs=azure-security-center) on the subscription level, but you may also [configure it on individual storage accounts](../storage/common/azure-defender-storage-configure.md?tabs=azure-portal).


## What is hash reputation analysis for malware?

To determine whether an uploaded file is suspicious, Microsoft Defender for Storage uses hash reputation analysis supported by [Microsoft Threat Intelligence](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2128684). The threat protection tools don’t scan the uploaded files, rather they examine the storage logs and compare the hashes of newly uploaded files with those of known viruses, trojans, spyware, and ransomware. 

When a file is suspected to contain malware, Defender for Cloud displays an alert and can optionally email the storage owner for approval to delete the suspicious file. To set up this automatic removal of files that hash reputation analysis indicates contain malware, deploy a [workflow automation to trigger on alerts that contain "Potential malware uploaded to a storage account”](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-security-center/how-to-respond-to-potential-malware-uploaded-to-azure-storage/ba-p/1452005).

> [!NOTE]
> To enable Defender for Cloud's threat protection capabilities, you must enable enhanced security features on the subscription containing the applicable workloads.
>
> You can enable **Microsoft Defender for Storage** at either the subscription level or resource level.

## Trigger a test alert for Microsoft Defender for Storage

To test the security alerts from Microsoft Defender for Storage in your environment, generate the alert "Access from a Tor exit node to a storage account" with the following steps:

1. Open a storage account with Microsoft Defender for Storage enabled.
1. From the sidebar, select “Containers” and open an existing container or create a new one.

1. Upload a file to that container.

    > [!CAUTION]
    > Don't upload a file containing sensitive data.

1. Use the context menu on the uploaded file to select “Generate SAS”.

    :::image type="content" source="media/defender-for-storage-introduction/generate-sas.png" alt-text="The generate SAS option for a file in a blob container.":::

1. Leave the default options and select **Generate SAS token and URL**.

1. Copy the generated SAS URL.

1. On your local machine, open the Tor browser.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can download Tor from the Tor Project site [https://www.torproject.org/download/](https://www.torproject.org/download/).

1. In the Tor browser, navigate to the SAS URL.

1. Download the file you uploaded in step 3.

    Within two hours you'll get the following security alert from Defender for Cloud:

    questions:
      - question: How do permissions work in Microsoft Defender for Cloud?
        answer: |
          Microsoft Defender for Cloud uses [Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md), which provides [built-in roles](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md) that can be assigned to users, groups, and services in Azure.
          
          Defender for Cloud assesses the configuration of your resources to identify security issues and vulnerabilities. In Defender for Cloud, you only see information related to a resource when you are assigned the role of Owner, Contributor, or Reader for the subscription or resource group that a resource belongs to.
          
          See [Permissions in Microsoft Defender for Cloud](permissions.md) to learn more about roles and allowed actions in Defender for Cloud.
          
          
          
      - question: Who can modify a security policy?
        answer: |
          To modify a security policy, you must be a Security Admin or an Owner or Contributor of that subscription.
          
          To learn how to configure a security policy, see [Setting security policies in Microsoft Defender for Cloud](tutorial-security-policy.md).

# Tutorial: Integrate ClearPass with Microsoft Defender for IoT

This tutorial will help you learn how to integrate ClearPass Policy Manager (CPPM) with Microsoft Defender for IoT.

The Defender for IoT platform delivers continuous ICS threat monitoring and device discovery, combining a deep embedded understanding of industrial protocols, devices, and applications with ICS-specific behavioral anomaly detection, threat intelligence, risk analytics, and automated threat modeling.

Defender for IoT detects, discovers, and classifies OT and ICS endpoints, and share information directly with ClearPass using the ClearPass Security Exchange framework, and the open API.

Defender for IoT automatically updates the ClearPass Policy Manager Endpoint Database with endpoint classification data and several custom security attributes.

The integration allows for the following:

- Viewing ICS, and SCADA security threats identified by Defender for IoT security engines.

- Viewing device inventory information discovered by the Defender for IoT sensor. The sensor delivers centralized visibility of all network devices, and endpoints across the IT, and OT infrastructure. From here a centralized endpoint and edge security policy can be defined and administered in the ClearPass system.

## Prerequisites

### Aruba ClearPass requirements

CPPM runs on hardware appliances with pre-installed software or as a Virtual Machine under the following hypervisors. Hypervisors that run on a client computer such as VMware Player are not supported.

- VMware ESXi 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 6.6 or higher.

- Microsoft Hyper-V Server 2012 R2 or 2016 R2.

- Hyper-V on Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 or 2016 R2.

- KVM on CentOS 7.5 or later.

### Defender for IoT requirements

- Defender for IoT version 2.5.1 or higher.

- An Azure account. If you do not already have an Azure account, you can [create your Azure free account today](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

## Create a ClearPass API user

As part of the communications channel between the two products, Defender for IoT uses many APIs (both TIPS, and REST). Access to the TIPS APIs is validated via username, and password combination credentials. This user ID needs to have minimum levels of access. Do not use a Super Administrator profile, use API Administrator as shown below.

**To create a ClearPass API user**:

1. In the left pane, select **Administration** > **Users and Privileges**, and select **ADD**.

1. In the **Add Admin User** dialog box, set the following parameters:

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-clearpass/policy-manager.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the administrator user's dialog box view.":::

    | Parameter | Description |
    |--|--|
    | **UserID** | Enter the user ID. |
    | **Name** | Enter the user name. |
    | **Password** | Enter the password. |
    | **Enable User** | Verify that this option is enabled. |
    | **Privilege Level** | Select **API Administrator**. |

1. Select **Add**.

## Create a ClearPass operator profile

Defender for IoT uses the REST API as part of the integration. REST APIs are authenticated under an OAuth framework. To sync with Defender for IoT, you need to create an API Client.

In order to secure access to the REST API for the API Client, create a restricted access operator profile.

**To create a ClearPass operator profile**:

1. Navigate to the **Edit Operator Profile** window.

1. Set all of the options to **No Access** except for the following:

| Parameter | Description |
|--|--|
| **API Services** | Set to **Allow Access** |
| **Policy Manager** | Set the following: <br />- **Dictionaries**: **Attributes** set to **Read, Write, Delete**<br />- **Dictionaries**: **Fingerprintsset** to **Read, Write, Delete**<br />- **Identity**: **Endpoints** set to **Read, Write, Delete** |

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-clearpass/policy.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the options from the Policy Manager screen.":::

## Create a ClearPass OAuth API client

1. In the main window, select **Administrator** > **API Services** > **API Clients**.

1. In the Create API Client tab, set the following parameters:

    - **Operating Mode**: This parameter is used for API calls to ClearPass. Select **ClearPass REST API – Client**.

    - **Operator Profile**: Use the profile you created previously.

    - **Grant Type**: Set **Client credentials (grant_type = client_credentials)**.

1. Ensure you record the **Client Secret** and the client ID. For example, `defender-rest`.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-clearpass/aruba.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create API Client.":::

1. In the Policy Manager, ensure you collected the following list of information before proceeding to the next step.

    - CPPM UserID

    - CPPM UserId Password

    - CPPM OAuth2 API Client ID

    - CPPM OAuth2 API Client Secret

## Configure Defender for IoT to integrate with ClearPass

To enable viewing the device inventory in ClearPass, you need to set up Defender for IoT-ClearPass sync. When the sync configuration is complete, the Defender for IoT platform updates the ClearPass Policy Manager EndpointDb as it discovers new endpoints.

**To configure ClearPass sync on the Defender for IoT sensor**:

1. In the Defender for IoT sensor, select **System Settings** from the left side panel.

1. In the **System Settings** pane, select :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-clearpass/clearpass-icon.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the ClearPass icon from the left side.":::.

1. Set the following parameters:

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-clearpass/settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the fill out the required information in the System Settings pane.":::

    - **Enable Sync:** Enable the sync between Defender for IoT and ClearPass

    - **Sync Frequency:** Define the sync frequency in minutes. The default is 60 minutes. The minimum is 5 minutes.

    - **ClearPass IP Address:** The IP address of the ClearPass system with which Defender for IoT is in sync.

    - **Client ID:** The client ID that was created on ClearPass for syncing the data with Defender for IoT.

    - **Client Secret:** The client secret that was created on ClearPass for syncing the data with Defender for IoT.

    - **Username:** The ClearPass administrator user.

    - **Password:** The ClearPass administrator password.

1. Select **Save**.

## Define a ClearPass forwarding rule

To enable viewing the alerts discovered by Defender for IoT in Aruba, you need to set the forwarding rule. This rule defines which information about the ICS, and SCADA security threats identified by Defender for IoT security engines is sent to ClearPass.

**To define a ClearPass forwarding rule on the Defender for IoT sensor**:

1. In the Defender for IoT sensor, select **Forwarding** from the left panel.

1. In the **Forwarding** pane, select **Create Forwarding Rule**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-clearpass/forwarding.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Forwarding pane with all of its options.":::

1. Add the name, and the severity of the rule, and then from the **Action** drop-down list, select **Send to** > **ClearPass**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-clearpass/rule.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the create a Forwarding Rule.":::

1. In the **Actions** pane, set the following parameters:

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-clearpass/actions.png" alt-text="Select your actions from the Actions pane.":::

    | Parameter | Description |
    |--|--|
    | **Host** | Type the ClearPass server IP address. |
    | **Port** | Type the port of the ClearPass on which the forwarding is done. |
    | **Configure** | Set-up the following options to allow viewing of Defender for IoT alerts in the ClearPass system: <br />- **Report illegal function codes:** Protocol violations - Illegal field value violating ICS protocol specification (potential exploit).<br />- **Report unauthorized PLC programming and firmware updates:** Unauthorized PLC changes.<br />- **Report unauthorized PLC stop:** PLC stop (downtime).<br />- **Report malware related alerts:** Industrial malware attempts, such as TRITON, NotPetya.<br />- **Report unauthorized scanning:** Unauthorized scanning (potential reconnaissance). |

1. Select **Submit**.

## Monitor ClearPass and Defender for IoT communication

Once the sync has started, endpoint data is populated directly into the Policy Manager EndpointDb, you can view the last update time from the integration configuration screen.

**To review the Last Sync time to ClearPass**:

1. Sign in to the Defender for IoT sensor.

1. Select **System Settings** from the left side panel.

1. Select **ClearPass**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-clearpass/last-sync.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the view the time and date of your last sync.":::

If Sync is not working, or shows an error, then, it’s likely you’ve missed capturing some of the information. Recheck the data recorded, additionally you can view the API calls between Defender for IoT and ClearPass from **Guest** > **Administration** > **Support** > **Application Log**.

Below is an example of API logs between Defender for IoT and ClearPass.

# Tutorial: Integrate Fortinet with Microsoft Defender for IoT

This tutorial will help you learn how to integrate, and use Fortinet with Microsoft Defender for IoT.

Microsoft Defender for IoT mitigates IIoT and ICS and SCADA risk with ICS-aware self-learning engines that deliver immediate insights about ICS devices, vulnerabilities, and threats.  Defender for IoT accomplishes this without relying on agents, rules, signatures, specialized skills, or prior knowledge of the environment.

Defender for IoT, and Fortinet have established a technological partnership that detects, and stop attacks on IoT, and ICS networks.

Fortinet, and Microsoft Defender for IoT prevent:

- Unauthorized changes to programmable logic controllers (PLC).

- Malware that manipulates ICS, and IoT devices via their native protocols.

- Reconnaissance tools from collecting data.

- Protocol violations caused by misconfigurations, or malicious attackers.

Defender for IoT detects anomalous behavior in IoT, and ICS networks and delivers that information to FortiGate, and FortiSIEM, as follows:

- **Visibility:** The information provided by Defender for IoT gives FortiSIEM administrators visibility into previously invisible IoT and ICS networks.

- **Blocking malicious attacks:** FortiGate administrators can use the information discovered by Defender for IoT to create rules to stop anomalous behavior, regardless of whether that behavior is caused by chaotic actors, or misconfigured devices, before it causes damage to production, profits, or people.

FortiSIEM, and Fortinet’s multivendor security incident, and events management solution brings visibility, correlation, automated response, and remediation to a single scalable solution.

Using a Business Services view, the complexity of managing network and security operations is reduced, freeing resources, improving breach detection. FortiSIEM provides cross correlation while applying machine learning, and UEBA to improve response, in order to stop breaches before they occur.

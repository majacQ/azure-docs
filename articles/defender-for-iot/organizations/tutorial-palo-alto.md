# Tutorial: Integrate Palo-Alto with Microsoft Defender for IoT

This tutorial will help you learn how to integrate, and use Palo Alto with Microsoft Defender for IoT.

Defender for IoT has integrated its continuous ICS threat monitoring platform with Palo Alto’s next-generation firewalls to enable blocking of critical threats, faster and more efficiently.

The following integration types are available:

- Automatic blocking option: Direct Defender for IoT to Palo Alto integration.

- Send recommendations for blocking to the central management system: Defender for IoT to Panorama integration.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Configure immediate blocking by a specified Palo Alto firewall
> - Create Panorama blocking policies in Defender for IoT

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

### Panorama permissions

- Confirmation by the Panorama Administrator to allow automatic blocking.

## Configure immediate blocking by a specified Palo Alto firewall

In cases, such as malware-related alerts, you can enable automatic blocking. Defender for IoT forwarding rules are utilized to send a blocking command directly to a specific Palo Alto firewall.

When Defender for IoT identifies a critical threat, it sends an alert that includes an option of blocking the infected source. Selecting **Block Source** in the alert’s details activates the forwarding rule, which sends the blocking command to the specified Palo Alto firewall.

**To configure immediate blocking**:

1. In the left pane, select **Forwarding**.

1. Select **Create Forwarding Rule**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-palo-alto/forwarding.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the forwarding alert screen.":::

1. From the Actions drop down menu, select **Send to Palo Alto NGFW**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-palo-alto/forward-rule.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the create Forwarding Rule screen.":::

1. In the Actions pane, set the following parameters:

   - **Host**: Enter the NGFW server IP address.
   - **Port**: Enter the NGFW server port.
   - **Username**: Enter the NGFW server username.
   - **Password**: Enter the NGFW server password.
   - **Configure**: Set up the following options to allow blocking of the suspicious sources by the Palo Alto firewall:
     - **Block illegal function codes**: Protocol violations - Illegal field value violating ICS protocol specification (potential exploit).
     - **Block unauthorized PLC programming/firmware updates**: Unauthorized PLC changes.
     - **Block unauthorized PLC stop**: PLC stop (downtime).
     - **Block malware-related alerts**: Blocking of industrial malware attempts (TRITON, NotPetya, etc.). You can select the option of **Automatic blocking**. In that case, the blocking is executed automatically and immediately.
     - **Block unauthorized scanning**: Unauthorized scanning (potential reconnaissance).

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-palo-alto/edit.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Edit your Forwarding Rule screen.":::

1. Select **Submit**.

You will then need to block any suspicious source.

**To block a suspicious source**:

1. Navigate to the **Alerts** pane, and select the alert related to the Palo Alto integration.

1. To automatically block the suspicious source, select **Block Source**. The **Please Confirm** dialog box appears.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-palo-alto/unauthorized.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Block Source button, to block the unauthorized source.":::

1. Select **OK**.

The suspicious source is now blocked by the Palo Alto firewall.

## Create Panorama blocking policies in Defender for IoT

Defender for IoT, and Palo Alto Network's integration automatically creates new policies in the Palo Alto Network's NMS, and Panorama.

This table shows which incidents this integration is intended for:

| Incident type | Description |
|--|--|
|**Unauthorized PLC changes** | An update to the ladder logic, or firmware of a device. This can represent legitimate activity, or an attempt to compromise the device. For example, malicious code, such as a Remote Access Trojan (RAT), or parameters that cause the physical process, such as a spinning turbine, to operate in an unsafe manner. |
|**Protocol Violation** | A packet structure, or field value that violates the protocol specification. This can represent a misconfigured application, or a malicious attempt to compromise the device. For example, causing a buffer overflow condition in the target device. |
|**PLC Stop** | A command that causes the device to stop functioning, thereby risking the physical process that is being controlled by the PLC. |
|**Industrial malware found in the ICS network** | Malware that manipulates ICS devices using their native protocols, such as TRITON and Industroyer. Defender for IoT also detects IT malware that has moved laterally into the ICS, and SCADA environment. For example, Conficker, WannaCry, and NotPetya. |
|**Scanning malware** | Reconnaissance tools that collect data about system configuration in a pre-attack phase. For example, the Havex Trojan scans industrial networks for devices using OPC, which is a standard protocol used by Windows-based SCADA systems to communicate with ICS devices. |

When Defender for IoT detects a pre-configured use case, the **Block Source** button is added to the alert. Then, when the CyberX user selects the **Block Source** button, Defender for IoT creates policies on Panorama by sending the predefined forwarding rule.

The policy is applied only when the Panorama administrator pushes it to the relevant NGFW in the network.

In IT networks, there may be dynamic IP addresses. Therefore, for those subnets, the policy must be based on FQDN (DNS name) and not the IP address. Defender for IoT performs reverse lookup and matches devices with dynamic IP address to their FQDN (DNS name) every configured number of hours.

In addition, Defender for IoT sends an email to the relevant Panorama user to notify that a new policy created by Defender for IoT is waiting for the approval. The figure below presents the Defender for IoT-Panorama Integration Architecture.

The first step in creating Panorama blocking policies in Defender for IoT is to configure DNS lookup.

**To configure DNS lookup**:

1. In the left pane, select **System Settings**.

1. Select the **DNS Settings** :::image type="icon" source="media/tutorial-palo-alto/settings.png"::: button.

1. In the **Edit DNS Settings** dialog box, set the following parameters:

   - **Status**: The status of the DNS resolver.

   - **DNS Server Address**: Enter the IP address, or the FQDN of the network DNS Server.
   - **DNS Server Port**: Enter the port used to query the DNS server.
   - **Subnets**: Set the Dynamic IP address subnet range. The range that Defender for IoT reverses lookup their IP address in the DNS server to match their current FQDN name.
   - **Schedule Reverse Lookup**: Define the scheduling options as follows:
     - By specific times: Specify when to perform the reverse lookup daily.
     - By fixed intervals (in hours): Set the frequency for performing the reverse lookup.
   - **Number of Labels**: Instruct Defender for IoT to automatically resolve network IP addresses to device FQDNs. <br />To configure DNS FQDN resolution, add the number of domain labels to display. Up to 30 characters are displayed from left to right.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-palo-alto/configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Configure the DNS settings screen.":::

1. Select **SAVE**.

To ensure your DNS settings are correct, select **Lookup Test**. The test ensures that the DNS server IP address, and DNS server port are set correctly.

## Block suspicious traffic with the Palo Alto firewall

Suspicious traffic will need to be blocked with the Palo Alto firewall. You can block suspicious traffic through the use forwarding rules in Defender for IoT.

**To block suspicious traffic with the Palo Alto firewall using a Defender for IoT forwarding rule**:

1. In the left pane, select **Forwarding**.

1. Select **Create Forwarding Rule**.

1. From the **Actions** drop down menu, select **Send to Palo Alto Panorama**.

1. In the Actions pane, set the following parameters:

   - **Host**: Enter the Panorama server IP address.

   - **Port**: Enter the Panorama server port.

   - **Username**: Enter the Panorama server username.

   - **Password**: Enter the Panorama server password.

   - **Report Address**: Define how the blocking is executed, as follows:

     - **By IP Address**: Always creates blocking policies on Panorama based on the IP address.

     - **By FQDN or IP Address**: Creates blocking policies on Panorama based on FQDN if it exists, otherwise by the IP Address.

   - **Email**: Set the email address for the policy notification email

    > [!NOTE]
    > Make sure you have configured a Mail Server in the Defender for IoT. If no email address is entered, Defender for IoT does not send a notification email.

   - **Execute a DNS lookup upon alert detection (Checkbox)**: When the FQDN, or IP Address option is set in the Report Address. This checkbox is selected by default. If only the IP address is set, this option is disabled.

   - **Configure**: Set up the following options to allow blocking of the suspicious sources by the Palo Alto Panorama:

     - **Block illegal function codes**: Protocol violations - Illegal field value violating ICS, protocol specification (potential exploit).

     - **Block unauthorized PLC programming/firmware updates**: Unauthorized PLC changes.

     - **Block unauthorized PLC stop**: PLC stop (downtime).

     - **Block malware-related alerts**: Blocking of industrial malware attempts (TRITON, NotPetya, etc.). You can select the option of **Automatic blocking**. In that case, the blocking is executed automatically and immediately.

     - **Block unauthorized scanning**: Unauthorized scanning (potential reconnaissance).

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-palo-alto/details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Select action screen.":::

# Azure Communication Services - Voice and video calling events

This article provides the properties and schema for communication services voice and video calling events.Â For an introduction to event schemas, see [Azure Event Grid event schema](event-schema.md).

## Events types

Azure Communication Services emits the following voice and video calling event types:

| Event type                                                  | Description                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Microsoft.Communication.RecordingFileStatusUpdated | Published when recording file is available |

## Event responses

When an event is triggered, the Event Grid service sends data about that event to subscribing endpoints.

This section contains an example of what that data would look like for each event.

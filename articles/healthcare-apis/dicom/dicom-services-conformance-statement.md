# DICOM Conformance Statement

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Healthcare APIs is currently in PREVIEW. The [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

The **Azure API for DICOM service** supports a subset of the DICOMweb&trade; Standard. This support includes:

* [Store (STOW-RS)](#store-stow-rs)
* [Retrieve (WADO-RS)](#retrieve-wado-rs)
* [Search (QIDO-RS)](#search-qido-rs)

Additionally, the following non-standard API(s) are supported:

- [Delete](#delete)

Our service also makes use of REST API versioning. For information on how to specify the version when making requests visit the [API Versioning for DICOM service Documentation](api-versioning-dicom-service.md).

## Store (STOW-RS)

This transaction uses the POST method to store representations of studies, series, and instances contained in the request payload.

| Method | Path               | Description |
| :----- | :----------------- | :---------- |
| POST   | ../studies         | Store instances. |
| POST   | ../studies/{study} | Store instances for a specific study. |

Parameter `study` corresponds to the DICOM attribute StudyInstanceUID. If it is specified, any instance that does not belong to the provided study will be rejected with a `43265` warning code.

The following `Accept` header(s) for the response are supported:

* `application/dicom+json`

The following `Content-Type` header(s) are supported:

* `multipart/related; type="application/dicom"`
* `application/dicom`

> [!NOTE]
> The Server **will not** coerce or replace attributes that conflict with existing data. All data will be stored as provided.

The following DICOM elements are required to be present in every DICOM file attempting to be stored:

* StudyInstanceUID
* SeriesInstanceUID
* SOPInstanceUID
* SOPClassUID
* PatientID

> [!NOTE]
> All identifiers must be between 1 and 64 characters long, and only contain alpha numeric characters or the following special characters: '.', '-'.

Each file stored must have a unique combination of StudyInstanceUID, SeriesInstanceUID, and SopInstanceUID. The warning code `45070` will be returned if a file with the same identifiers already exists.

DICOM File Size Limit: there is a size limit of 2 GB for a DICOM file by default.

### Store response status codes

| Code                         | Description |
| :--------------------------- | :---------- |
| 200 (OK)                     | All the SOP instances in the request have been stored. |
| 202 (Accepted)               | Some instances in the request have been stored but others have failed. |
| 204 (No Content)             | No content was provided in the store transaction request. |
| 400 (Bad Request)            | The request was badly formatted. For example, the provided study instance identifier did not conform to the expected UID format. |
| 401 (Unauthorized)           | The client is not authenticated. |
| 403 (Forbidden)              | The user is not authorized. |
| 406 (Not Acceptable)         | The specified `Accept` header is not supported. |

### Store failure reason codes

| Code  | Description |
| :---- | :---------- |
| 272   | The store transaction did not store the instance because of a general failure in processing the operation. |
| 43264 | The DICOM instance failed the validation. |
| 43265 | The provided instance StudyInstanceUID did not match the specified StudyInstanceUID in the store request. |
| 45070 | A DICOM instance with the same StudyInstanceUID, SeriesInstanceUID, and SopInstanceUID has already been stored. If you wish to update the contents, delete this instance first. |
| 45071 | A DICOM instance is being created by another process, or the previous attempt to create has failed and the cleanup process has not had chance to clean up yet. Delete the instance first before attempting to create again. |

## Retrieve (WADO-RS)

This Retrieve Transaction offers support for retrieving stored studies, series, instances, and frames by reference.

| Method | Path                                                                    | Description |

### Retrieve instances within study or series

The following `Accept` header(s) are supported for retrieving instances within a study or a series:


* `multipart/related; type="application/dicom"; transfer-syntax=*`
* `multipart/related; type="application/dicom";` (when transfer-syntax is not specified, 1.2.840.10008.1.2.1 is used as default)
* `multipart/related; type="application/dicom"; transfer-syntax=1.2.840.10008.1.2.1`
* `multipart/related; type="application/dicom"; transfer-syntax=1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.90`

### Retrieve an instance

The following `Accept` header(s) are supported for retrieving a specific instance:

* `application/dicom; transfer-syntax=*`
* `multipart/related; type="application/dicom"; transfer-syntax=*`
* `application/dicom;` (when transfer-syntax is not specified, 1.2.840.10008.1.2.1 is used as default)
* `multipart/related; type="application/dicom"` (when transfer-syntax is not specified, 1.2.840.10008.1.2.1 is used as default)
* `application/dicom; transfer-syntax=1.2.840.10008.1.2.1`
* `multipart/related; type="application/dicom"; transfer-syntax=1.2.840.10008.1.2.1`

* `multipart/related; type="image/jp2";transfer-syntax=1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.90`

### Retrieve transfer syntax

When the requested transfer syntax is different from original file, the original file is transcoded to requested transfer syntax. The original file needs to be one of the formats below for transcoding to succeed; otherwise, transcoding may fail:

* 1.2.840.10008.1.2 (Little Endian Implicit)
* 1.2.840.10008.1.2.1 (Little Endian Explicit)
* 1.2.840.10008.1.2.2 (Explicit VR Big Endian)

* 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.57 (JPEG Lossless)
* 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.70 (JPEG Lossless Selection Value 1)
* 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.90 (JPEG 2000 Lossless Only)
* 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.91 (JPEG 2000)
* 1.2.840.10008.1.2.5 (RLE Lossless)

An unsupported `transfer-syntax` will result in `406 Not Acceptable`.

### Retrieve metadata (for study, series, or instance)

The following `Accept` header(s) are supported for retrieving metadata for a study, a series, or an instance:

* `application/dicom+json`

Retrieving metadata will not return attributes with the following value representations:

| VR Name | Description            |
| :------ | :--------------------- |

| OW      | Other Word             |
| UN      | Unknown                |

### Retrieve metadata cache validation for (study, series, or instance)

Cache validation is supported using the `ETag` mechanism. In the response to a metadata request, ETag is returned as one of the headers. This ETag can be cached and added as `If-None-Match` header in the later requests for the same metadata. Two types of responses are possible if the data exists:

* Data has not changed since the last request: HTTP 304 (Not Modified) response will be sent with no response body.
* Data has changed since the last request: HTTP 200 (OK) response will be sent with updated ETag. Required data will also be returned as part of the body.

### Retrieve response status codes

| Code                         | Description |
| :--------------------------- | :---------- |
| 200 (OK)                     | All requested data has been retrieved. |
| 304 (Not Modified)           | The requested data has not been modified since the last request. Content is not added to the response body in such case. For more information, see the above section **Retrieve Metadata Cache Validation (for Study, Series, or Instance)**. |
| 400 (Bad Request)            | The request was badly formatted. For example, the provided study instance identifier did not conform to the expected UID format, or the requested transfer-syntax encoding is not supported. |
| 401 (Unauthorized)           | The client is not authenticated. |
| 403 (Forbidden)              | The user is not authorized. |

### Supported search parameters

The following parameters for each query are supported:

| Key              | Support Value(s)              | Allowed Count | Description |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------- | :------------ | :---------- |
| `{attributeID}=` | {value}                       | 0...N         | Search for attribute/ value matching in query. |
| `includefield=`  | `{attributeID}`<br/>`all`   | 0...N         | The additional attributes to return in the response. Both, public and private tags are supported.<br/>When `all` is provided. Refer to [Search Response](#search-response) for more information about which attributes will be returned for each query type.<br/>If a mixture of {attributeID} and 'all' is provided, the server will default to using 'all'. |
| `limit=`         | {value}                       | 0..1          | Integer value to limit the number of values returned in the response.<br/>Value can be between the range 1 >= x <= 200. Defaulted to 100. |
| `offset=`        | {value}                       | 0..1          | Skip {value} results.<br/>If an offset is provided larger than the number of search query results, a 204 (no content) response will be returned. |
| `fuzzymatching=` | `true` \| `false`             | 0..1          | If true fuzzy matching is applied to PatientName attribute. It will do a prefix word match of any name part inside PatientName value. For example, if PatientName is "John^Doe", then "joh", "do", "jo do", "Doe" and "John Doe" will all match. However, "ohn" will not match. |

#### Searchable attributes

We support searching the following attributes and search types.

| Attribute Keyword | Study | Series | Instance |
| :---------------- | :---: | :----: | :------: |
| StudyInstanceUID | X | X | X |
| PatientName | X | X | X |
| PatientID | X | X | X |
| AccessionNumber | X | X | X |
| ReferringPhysicianName | X | X | X |
| StudyDate | X | X | X |
| StudyDescription | X | X | X |
| SeriesInstanceUID |  | X | X |
| Modality |  | X | X |

#### Search matching

We support the following matching types.

| Search Type | Supported Attribute | Example |
| :---------- | :------------------ | :------ |
| Range Query | StudyDate | {attributeID}={value1}-{value2}. For date/ time values, we supported an inclusive range on the tag. This will be mapped to `attributeID >= {value1} AND attributeID <= {value2}`. |
| Exact Match | All supported attributes | {attributeID}={value1} |
| Fuzzy Match | PatientName | Matches any component of the patient name that starts with the value. |

#### Attribute ID

Tags can be encoded in many ways for the query parameter. We have partially implemented the standard as defined in [PS3.18 6.7.1.1.1](http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/2019a/output/chtml/part18/sect_6.7.html#sect_6.7.1.1.1). The following encodings for a tag are supported:

| :--------------- | :--------------- |
| {group}{element} | 0020000D         |
| {dicomKeyword}   | StudyInstanceUID |

Example query searching for instances: **../instances?Modality=CT&00280011=512&includefield=00280010&limit=5&offset=0**

* If the target resource is Study's Instances, then Series level attributes are also returned.

### Search response codes

The query API returns one of the following status codes in the response:

| Code                      | Description |
| :------------------------ | :---------- |
| 200 (OK)                  | The response payload contains all the matching resources. |
| 204 (No Content)          | The search completed successfully but returned no results. |
| 400 (Bad Request)         | The server was unable to perform the query because the query component was invalid. Response body contains details of the failure. |
| 401 (Unauthorized)        | The client is not authenticated. |
| 403 (Forbidden)           | The user is not authorized. |
| 503 (Service Unavailable) | The service is unavailable or busy. Please try again later. |

### Extra notes

* Querying using the `TimezoneOffsetFromUTC` (`00080201`) is not supported.
* The query API will not return 413 (request entity too large). If the requested query response limit is outside of the acceptable range, a bad request will be returned. Anything requested within the acceptable range will be resolved.
* When target resource is study/series, there is a potential for inconsistent study/series level metadata across multiple instances. For example, two instances could have different patientName. In this case, the latest will win, and you can search only on the latest data.
* Paged results are optimized to return the matched *newest* instance first. This may result in duplicate records in subsequent pages if newer data matching the query was added.
* Matching is case in-sensitive and accent in-sensitive for PN VR types.
* Matching is case in-sensitive and accent sensitive for other string VR types.

## Delete

This transaction is not part of the official DICOMweb&trade; Standard. It uses the DELETE method to remove representations of studies, series, and instances from the store.

| Method | Path                                                    | Description |
| :----- | :------------------------------------------------------ | :---------- |
| DELETE | ../studies/{study}                                      | Delete all instances for a specific study. |
| DELETE | ../studies/{study}/series/{series}                      | Delete all instances for a specific series within a study. |
| DELETE | ../studies/{study}/series/{series}/instances/{instance} | Delete a specific instance within a series. |

Parameters `study`, `series`, and `instance` correspond to the DICOM attributes StudyInstanceUID, SeriesInstanceUID, and SopInstanceUID respectively.

There are no restrictions on the request's `Accept` header, `Content-Type` header or body content.

> [!NOTE]
> After a Delete transaction, the deleted instances won't be recoverable.

### Response Status Codes

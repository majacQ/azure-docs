# How to display IoT connector Metrics

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Healthcare APIs is currently in PREVIEW. The [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

In this article, you'll learn how to display IoT connector Metrics in the Azure portal. 

## Display Metrics

1. Within your Azure Healthcare APIs Workspace, select **IoT connectors**. 

     :::image type="content" source="media\iot-metrics\iot-workspace-displayed-with-connectors-button.png" alt-text="Select the IoT connectors button." lightbox="media\iot-metrics\iot-connectors-button.png"::: 

2. Select the IoT connector that you would like to display the Metrics for.

    :::image type="content" source="media\iot-metrics\iot-connector-select.png" alt-text="Select IoT connector you would like to display Metrics for." lightbox="media\iot-metrics\iot-connector-select.png":::
    
3. Select **Metrics** within the IoT connector page.

   :::image type="content" source="media\iot-metrics\iot-select-metrics.png" alt-text="Select the Metrics button." lightbox="media\iot-metrics\iot-metrics-button.png"::: 

4. From the Metrics page, you can create the Metrics that you want to display for your IoT connector. For this example, we'll be choosing the following selections:

    * **Scope** = IoT connector name (**Default**)
    * **Metric Namespace** = Standard Metrics (**Default**) 
    * **Metric** = IoT connector metrics you want to display. For this example, we'll choose **Number of Incoming Messages**.
    * **Aggregation** = How you would like to display the metrics. For this example, we'll choose **Count**. 

    :::image type="content" source="media\iot-metrics\iot-select-metrics-to-display.png" alt-text="Select Metrics to display." lightbox="media\iot-metrics\iot-metrics-selection-close-up.png"::: 

5. We can now see the IoT connector Metrics for **Number of Incoming Messages** displayed on the Azure portal.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can add additional Metrics by selecting the **Add metric** button and making your choices.

    :::image type="content" source="media\iot-metrics\iot-metrics-add-button.png" alt-text="Select Add metric button to add more Metrics." lightbox="media\iot-metrics\iot-add-metric-button.png":::

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you leave the Metrics page, the Metrics settings are lost and will have to be recreated. If you would like to save your IoT connector Metrics for future viewing, you can pin them to an Azure dashboard as a tile.

## Pinning Metrics tile on Azure portal dashboard

1. To pin the Metrics tile to an Azure portal dashboard, select the **Pin to dashboard** button:

    :::image type="content" source="media\iot-metrics\iot-metrics-select-add-pin-to-dashboard.png" alt-text="Select the Pin to dashboard button." lightbox="media\iot-metrics\iot-pin-to-dashboard-button.png":::

2. Select the dashboard you would like to display IoT connector Metrics on. For this example, we'll use a private dashboard named `IoT connector Metrics`. Select **Pin** to add the Metrics tile to the dashboard.

    :::image type="content" source="media\iot-metrics\iot-select-pin-to-dashboard.png" alt-text="Select dashboard and Pin button to complete the dashboard pinning process." lightbox="media\iot-metrics\iot-select-pin-to-dashboard.png":::

3. You'll receive a confirmation that the Metrics tile was successfully added to the dashboard.

    :::image type="content" source="media\iot-metrics\iot-select-dashboard-pinned-successful.png" alt-text="Metrics tile successfully pinned to dashboard." lightbox="media\iot-metrics\iot-select-dashboard-pinned-successful.png":::

4. Once you've received a successful confirmation, select **Dashboard**.

    :::image type="content" source="media\iot-metrics\iot-select-dashboard-with-metrics-tile.png" alt-text="Select the Dashboard button." lightbox="media\iot-metrics\iot-dashboard-button.png":::

5. Select the dashboard that you pinned the Metrics tile to. For this example, the dashboard is `IoT connector Metrics`. The dashboard will display the IoT connector Metrics tile that you created in the previous steps.

    :::image type="content" source="media\iot-metrics\iot-dashboard-with-metrics-tile-displayed.png" alt-text="Dashboard with pinned IoT connector Metrics tile." lightbox="media\iot-metrics\iot-dashboard-with-metrics-tile-displayed.png":::

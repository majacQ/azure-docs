# How to use CollectionContentTemplate mappings

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Healthcare APIs is currently in PREVIEW. The [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

> [!TIP]
> Check out the [IoMT Connector Data Mapper](https://github.com/microsoft/iomt-fhir/tree/master/tools/data-mapper) tool for editing, testing, and troubleshooting IoT connector Device and FHIR destination mappings. Export mappings for uploading to IoT connector in the Azure portal or use with the [open-source version](https://github.com/microsoft/iomt-fhir) of IoT connector.

This article describes how to use CollectionContentTemplate mappings with IoT connector Device mappings templates.

## CollectionContentTemplate

The CollectionContentTemplate may be used to represent a list of templates that will be used during normalization.
                                                             
### Example

```json
{
  "templateType": "CollectionContent",
  "template": [
    {
      "templateType": "CalculatedContent",
      "template": {
        "typeName": "heartrate",
        "typeMatchExpression": "$..[?(@heartRate)]",
        "deviceIdExpression": "$.matchedToken.deviceId",
        "timestampExpression": "$.matchedToken.endDate",
        "values": [
          {
            "required": "true",
            "valueExpression": "$.matchedToken.heartRate",
            "valueName": "hr"
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "templateType": "CalculatedContent",
      "template": {
        "typeName": "stepcount",
        "typeMatchExpression": "$..[?(@steps)]",
        "deviceIdExpression": "$.matchedToken.deviceId",
        "timestampExpression": "$.matchedToken.endDate",
        "values": [
          {
            "required": "true",
            "valueExpression": "$.matchedToken.steps",
            "valueName": "steps"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}

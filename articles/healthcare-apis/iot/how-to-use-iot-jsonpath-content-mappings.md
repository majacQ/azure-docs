# How to use IotJsonPathContentTemplate mappings

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Healthcare APIs is currently in PREVIEW. The [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

> [!TIP]
> Check out the [IoMT Connector Data Mapper](https://github.com/microsoft/iomt-fhir/tree/master/tools/data-mapper) tool for editing, testing, and troubleshooting IoT connector Device and FHIR destination mappings. Export mappings for uploading to IoT connector in the Azure portal or use with the [open-source version](https://github.com/microsoft/iomt-fhir) of IoT connector.

This article describes how to use IoTJsonPathContentTemplate mappings with IoT connector Device mappings templates.

## IotJsonPathContentTemplate

The IotJsonPathContentTemplate is similar to the JsonPathContentTemplate except the `DeviceIdExpression` and `TimestampExpression` aren't required.

The assumption, when using this template, is the messages being evaluated were sent using the [Azure IoT Hub Device SDKs](../../iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-sdks.md#azure-iot-hub-device-sdks) or  [Export Data (legacy)](../../iot-central/core/howto-export-data-legacy.md) feature of [Azure IoT Central](../../iot-central/core/overview-iot-central.md). 

When you're using these SDKs, the device identity and the timestamp of the message are known.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Make sure that you're using a device identifier from Azure Iot Hub or Azure IoT Central that is registered as an identifer for a device resource on the destination FHIR service.

If you're using Azure IoT Hub Device SDKs, you can still use the JsonPathContentTemplate, assuming that you're using custom properties in the message body for the device identity or measurement timestamp

> [!NOTE]
> When using `IotJsonPathContentTemplate`, the `TypeMatchExpression` should resolve to the entire message as a JToken. For more information, see the following examples:

### Examples

**Heart rate**

*Message*

```json
{
    "Body": {
        "heartRate": "78"        
    },
    "Properties": {
        "iothub-creation-time-utc" : "2021-02-01T22:46:01.8750000Z"
    },
    "SystemProperties": {
        "iothub-connection-device-id" : "device123"
    }
}
```

*Template*

```json

    "templateType": "JsonPathContent",
    "template": {
        "typeName": "heartrate",
        "typeMatchExpression": "$..[?(@Body.heartRate)]",
        "deviceIdExpression": "$.deviceId",
        "timestampExpression": "$.endDate",
        "values": [
            {
                "required": "true",
                "valueExpression": "$.Body.heartRate",
                "valueName": "hr"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

**Blood pressure**

*Message*

```json
{
    "Body": {
        "systolic": "123",
        "diastolic" : "87"
    },
    "Properties": {
        "iothub-creation-time-utc" : "2021-02-01T22:46:01.8750000Z"
    },
    "SystemProperties": {
        "iothub-connection-device-id" : "device123"
    }
}
```

*Template*

```json
{
    "typeName": "bloodpressure",
    "typeMatchExpression": "$..[?(@Body.systolic && @Body.diastolic)]",
    "values": [
        {
            "required": "true",
            "valueExpression": "$.Body.systolic",
            "valueName": "systolic"
        },
        {
            "required": "true",
            "valueExpression": "$.Body.diastolic",
            "valueName": "diastolic"
        }
    ]
}
```

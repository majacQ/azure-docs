# IoT connector troubleshooting guide

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Healthcare APIs is currently in PREVIEW. The [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability. 

> [!TIP]
> When opening an [Azure Technical Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket/) ticket for the IoT connector, include copies of your Device and FHIR destination mappings to assist in the troubleshooting process.

This article provides steps for troubleshooting common IoT connector error messages and conditions. You'll also learn how to create copies of the IoT connector's Device and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR&#174;) destination mappings. Also, you can use the Device and FHIR destination mapping copies for editing and archiving outside of the Azure portal. 

## Device and FHIR destination mappings validations

This section describes the validation process that IoT connector does. The validation process validates the Device and FHIR destination mappings before allowing them to be saved for use. These elements are required in the Device and FHIR destination mappings.

> [!TIP]
> Check out the [IoMT Connector Data Mapper](https://github.com/microsoft/iomt-fhir/tree/master/tools/data-mapper) tool for editing, testing, and troubleshooting IoT connector Device and FHIR destination mappings. Export mappings for uploading to IoT connector in the Azure portal or use with the [open-source version](https://github.com/microsoft/iomt-fhir) of IoT connector.

**Device mappings**

|Element|Required|
|:-------|:------|
|TypeName|True|
|TypeMatchExpression|True|
|DeviceIdExpression|True|
|TimestampExpression|True|
|Values[].ValueName|True|
|Values[].ValueExpression|True|

> [!NOTE]
> `Values[].ValueName and Values[].ValueExpression` elements are only required if you have a value entry in the array. It's valid to have no values mapped. This is used when the telemetry being sent is an event. 
>
>For example:
> 
>When a wearable IoMT device is put on or removed, the element(s) don't have any values except for a name that IoT connector matches and emits. On the FHIR conversion, IoT connector maps it to a code-able concept based on the semantic type. This means that no actual values are populated.

**FHIR destination mappings**

|Element|Required|
|:------|:-------|
|TypeName|True|

> [!NOTE]
> This is the only required FHIR destination mapping element validated at this time.

### Destination Resource

|Message|Displayed|Condition|Fix| 
|-------|---------|---------|---|
|The maximum number of resource type `iotconnectors/destinations` has been reached.|API and Azure portal|IoT connector Destination Resource quota is reached and the default is 1 per IoT connector).|Delete the existing instance of IoT connector Destination Resource. Only one Destination Resource is permitted per IoT connector.
|The `fhirServiceResourceId` provided is invalid.|API and Azure portal|The `properties.fhirServiceResourceId` provided in the Destination Resource provisioning request is not a valid resource ID for an instance of the Azure Healthcare APIs FHIR service.|Ensure the resource ID is formatted correctly, and make sure the resource ID is for an Azure Healthcare APIs FHIR instance. The format should be: `/subscriptions/{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}/resourceGroups/{RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME}/providers/Microsoft.HealthcareApis/services/{FHIR_SERVER_NAME} or /subscriptions/{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}/resourceGroups/{RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME}/providers/Microsoft.HealthcareApis/workspaces/{WORKSPACE_NAME}/`
|Ancestor resources must be fully provisioned before a child resource can be provisioned.|API|The parent Workspace or the parent IoT connector is still provisioning.|Wait until the parent Workspace or the parent IoT connector provisioning completes, and then submit the provisioning request again.
|`Location` property of child resources must match the `Location` property of parent resources.|API|The Destination provisioning request `location` property is different from the parent IoT connector `location` property.|Set the `location` property of the Destination in the provisioning request to the same value as the parent IoT connector `location` property.

## Why is IoT connector data not showing up in the FHIR service?

|Potential issues|Fixes|
|----------------|-----|
|Data is still being processed.|Data is egressed to the FHIR service in batches (every ~15 minutes).  Itâ€™s possible the data is still being processed and extra time is needed for the data to be persisted in the FHIR service.|
|Device mapping hasn't been configured.|Configure and save conforming Device mapping.|
|FHIR destination mapping hasn't been configured.|Configure and save conforming FHIR destination mapping.|
|The device message doesn't contain an expected expression defined in the Device mapping.|Verify `JsonPath` expressions defined in the Device mapping match tokens defined in the device message.|
|A Device Resource hasn't been created in the FHIR service (Resolution Type: Lookup only)*.|Create a valid Device Resource in the FHIR service. Ensure the Device Resource contains an identifier that matches the device identifier provided in the incoming message.|
|A Patient Resource hasn't been created in the FHIR service (Resolution Type: Lookup only)*.|Create a valid Patient Resource in the FHIR service.|
|The `Device.patient` reference isn't set, or the reference is invalid (Resolution Type: Lookup only)*.|Make sure the Device Resource contains a valid [Reference](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/device-definitions.html#Device.patient) to a Patient Resource.| 

*Reference [Quickstart: Deploy IoT connector using Azure portal](deploy-iot-connector-in-azure.md) for a functional description of the IoT connector resolution types (For example: Lookup or Create).

### The operation performed by IoT connector

## Creating copies of IoT connector Device and FHIR destination mappings

Copying IoT connector mappings can be useful for editing and archiving outside of the Azure portal website.

The mapping copies should be provided to Azure Technical Support when opening a support ticket to help with the troubleshooting process.

> [!NOTE]
> JSON is the only supported format for Device and FHIR destination mappings at this time.

> [!TIP]

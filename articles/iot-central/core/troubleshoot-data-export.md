# Troubleshoot issues with data exports from your Azure IoT Central application

This document helps you find out why the data your IoT Central application isn't reaching it's intended destination or isn't arriving in the correct format.

## Managed identity issues

You're using a managed identity to authorize the connection to an export destination. Data is not arriving at the export destination.

Before you configure or enable the export destination, make sure that you complete the following steps:

- Enable the managed identity for the the application.
- Configure the permissions for the managed identity.
- Configure any virtual networks, private endpoints, and firewall policies.

To learn more, see [Export data](howto-export-data.md?tabs=managed-identity).

If you need more help, you can contact the Azure experts on the [MSDN Azure and Stack Overflow forums](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/community/). Alternatively, you can file an [Azure support ticket](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Support).

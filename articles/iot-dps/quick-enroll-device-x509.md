# Quickstart: Enroll a group of devices to the Device Provisioning Service using X.509 certificate attestation 

:::zone pivot="programming-language-csharp,programming-language-nodejs, programming-language-python"

This quickstart shows you how to programmatically create an [enrollment group](concepts-service.md#enrollment-group) that uses intermediate or root CA X.509 certificates. The enrollment group is created by using the [Microsoft Azure IoT SDK](../iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-sdks.md) and a sample application. An enrollment group controls access to the provisioning service for devices that share a common signing certificate in their certificate chain. To learn more, see [Controlling device access to the provisioning service with X.509 certificates](./concepts-x509-attestation.md#controlling-device-access-to-the-provisioning-service-with-x509-certificates). For more information about using X.509 certificate-based Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) with Azure IoT Hub and Device Provisioning Service, see [X.509 CA certificate security overview](../iot-hub/iot-hub-x509ca-overview.md).

## Prepare test certificates

For this quickstart, you must have a *.pem* or a *.cer* file that contains the public portion of an intermediate or root CA X.509 certificate. This certificate must be uploaded to your provisioning service, and verified by the service.

:::zone pivot="programming-language-csharp,programming-language-nodejs, programming-language-python"

### Clone the Azure IoT C SDK

The [Azure IoT C SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c) contains test tooling that can help you create an X.509 certificate chain, upload a root or intermediate certificate from that chain, and do proof-of-possession with the service to verify the certificate.

If you've already cloned the latest release of the [Azure IoT C SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c) GitHub repository, skip to the [next section](#create-the-test-certificate).

1. Open a web browser, and go to the [Release page of the Azure IoT C SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/releases/latest).

2. Copy the tag name for the latest release of the Azure IoT C SDK.

3. Open a command prompt or Git Bash shell. Run the following commands to clone the latest release of the [Azure IoT C SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c) GitHub repository. (replace `<release-tag>` with the tag you copied in the previous step).

    ```cmd/sh
    git clone -b <release-tag> https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c.git
    cd azure-iot-sdk-c
    git submodule update --init
    ```

    This operation may take several minutes to complete.

4. The test tooling should now be located in the *azure-iot-sdk-c/tools/CACertificates* of the repository that you cloned.

    ```

:::zone-end

### Create the test certificate

To create the test certificate:

:::zone pivot="programming-language-csharp,programming-language-nodejs, programming-language-python"

To create the certificate, follow the steps in [Managing test CA certificates for samples and tutorials](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/master/tools/CACertificates/CACertificateOverview.md).

>[!TIP]
>In addition to the tooling in the C SDK, the [Group certificate verification sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-iot-samples-csharp/tree/master/provisioning/Samples/service/GroupCertificateVerificationSample) in the *Microsoft Azure IoT SDK for .NET* shows how to do proof-of-possession in C# with an existing X.509 intermediate or root CA certificate.

:::zone-end

:::zone pivot="programming-language-java"

1. In a command window, go to the folder *_azure-iot-sdk-java/provisioning/provisioning-tools/provisioning-x509-cert-generator_*.

2. To build the tool, run the following command:

    ```cmd\sh
    mvn clean install
    ```

3. To run the tool, use the following commands:

    ```cmd\sh
    cd target
    java -jar ./provisioning-x509-cert-generator-{version}-with-deps.jar
    ```

4. When prompted, you may optionally enter a _Common Name_ for your certificates.

5. The tool locally generates a *Client Cert*, the *Client Cert Private Key*, and the *Root Cert*. Copy the *Root Cert*, as you'll need it to modify the sample code.

6. Close the command window, or enter **n** when prompted for *Verification Code*.

:::zone-end

### Add and verify your test certificate

    ![Get provisioning service connection string from the portal](media/quick-enroll-device-x509/get-service-connection-string.png)

## Create the enrollment group sample

:::zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"

This section shows you how to create a .NET Core console application that adds an enrollment group to your provisioning service.

>[!TIP]
>You can, with some modification, follow these steps to create a [Windows IoT Core](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot) console application that adds an enrollment group. To learn more about developing with IoT Core, see the [Windows IoT Core developer documentation](/windows/iot-core/).

1. Open Visual Studio, and select **Create a new project**.

2. In the **Create a new project** panel, select **Console Application*.

3. Select **Next**.

4. For **Project name**, type *CreateEnrollmentGroup*.

5. Select**Next**. Keep the default **Target framework**.

6. Select **Create**.

7. After the solution opens, in the **Solution Explorer** pane, right-click the **CreateEnrollmentGroup** project, and then select **Manage NuGet Packages**.

8. In **NuGet Package Manager**, select **Browse**.

9. Type in and select *Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Provisioning.Service*.

10. Select **Install**.

    ![NuGet Package Manager window](media//quick-enroll-device-x509/add-nuget.png)

    This step downloads, installs, and adds a reference to the [Azure IoT Provisioning Service Client SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Provisioning.Service/) NuGet package and its dependencies.

11. Add the following `using` statements after the other `using` statements at the top of `Program.cs`:

    ```csharp
    using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
    using Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Provisioning.Service;
    ```

12. Add the following fields to the `Program` class, and make the listed changes.  

    ```csharp
    private static string ProvisioningConnectionString = "{ProvisioningServiceConnectionString}";
    private static string EnrollmentGroupId = "enrollmentgrouptest";
    private static string X509RootCertPath = @"{Path to a .cer or .pem file for a verified root CA or intermediate CA X.509 certificate}";
    ```

13. Replace the `ProvisioningServiceConnectionString` placeholder value with the connection string of the provisioning service that you copied in the previous section.

14. Replace the `X509RootCertPath` placeholder value with the path to a .pem or .cer file. This file represents the public part of an intermediate or root CA X.509 certificate that has been previously uploaded and verified with your provisioning service.

15. You may optionally change the `EnrollmentGroupId` value. The string can contain only lower case characters and hyphens.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > In production code, be aware of the following security considerations:
    >
    > * Hard-coding the connection string for the provisioning service administrator is against security best practices. Instead, the connection string should be held in a secure manner, such as in a secure configuration file or in the registry.
    > * Be sure to upload only the public part of the signing certificate. Never upload .pfx (PKCS12) or .pem files containing private keys to the provisioning service.

16. Add the following method to the `Program` class. This code creates an enrollment group entry and then calls the `CreateOrUpdateEnrollmentGroupAsync` method on `ProvisioningServiceClient` to add the enrollment group to the provisioning service.

    ```csharp
    public static async Task RunSample()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Starting sample...");
    
        using (ProvisioningServiceClient provisioningServiceClient =
                ProvisioningServiceClient.CreateFromConnectionString(ProvisioningConnectionString))
        {
            #region Create a new enrollmentGroup config
            Console.WriteLine("\nCreating a new enrollmentGroup...");
            var certificate = new X509Certificate2(X509RootCertPath);
            Attestation attestation = X509Attestation.CreateFromRootCertificates(certificate);
            EnrollmentGroup enrollmentGroup =
                    new EnrollmentGroup(
                            EnrollmentGroupId,
                            attestation)
                    {
                        ProvisioningStatus = ProvisioningStatus.Enabled
                    };
            Console.WriteLine(enrollmentGroup);
            #endregion
    
            #region Create the enrollmentGroup
            Console.WriteLine("\nAdding new enrollmentGroup...");
            EnrollmentGroup enrollmentGroupResult =
                await provisioningServiceClient.CreateOrUpdateEnrollmentGroupAsync(enrollmentGroup).ConfigureAwait(false);
            Console.WriteLine("\nEnrollmentGroup created with success.");
            Console.WriteLine(enrollmentGroupResult);
            #endregion
    
        }
    }
    ```

17. Finally, replace the `Main` method with the following lines:

    ```csharp
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        await RunSample();
        Console.WriteLine("\nHit <Enter> to exit ...");
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
    ```

18. Build the solution.

This section shows you how to create a node.js script that adds an enrollment group to your provisioning service.

1. From a command window in your working folder, run:

     ```cmd\sh
     npm install azure-iot-provisioning-service
     ```  

2. Using a text editor, create a **create_enrollment_group.js** file in your working folder. Add the following code to the file and save:

    ```javascript
        'use strict';
        var fs = require('fs');
    
        var provisioningServiceClient = require('azure-iot-provisioning-service').ProvisioningServiceClient;
    
        var serviceClient = provisioningServiceClient.fromConnectionString(process.argv[2]);
    
        var enrollment = {
          enrollmentGroupId: 'first',
          attestation: {
            type: 'x509',
            x509: {
              signingCertificates: {
                primary: {
                  certificate: fs.readFileSync(process.argv[3], 'utf-8').toString()
                }
              }
            }
          },
          provisioningStatus: 'disabled'
        };
    
        serviceClient.createOrUpdateEnrollmentGroup(enrollment, function(err, enrollmentResponse) {
          if (err) {
            console.log('error creating the group enrollment: ' + err);
          } else {
            console.log("enrollment record returned: " + JSON.stringify(enrollmentResponse, null, 2));
            enrollmentResponse.provisioningStatus = 'enabled';
            serviceClient.createOrUpdateEnrollmentGroup(enrollmentResponse, function(err, enrollmentResponse) {
              if (err) {
                console.log('error updating the group enrollment: ' + err);
              } else {
                console.log("updated enrollment record returned: " + JSON.stringify(enrollmentResponse, null, 2));
              }
            });
          }
        });
    ```

:::zone-end

:::zone pivot="programming-language-python"

This section shows you how to create a Python script that adds an enrollment group to your provisioning service.

1. Using a text editor, create a new *EnrollmentGroup.py* file.

2. Copy the following Python code into the file(replace `{dpsConnectionString}` with the connection string you copied earlier, the certificate placeholder with the certificate created in 
[Prepare test certificates](#prepare-test-certificates), and `{registrationid}` with a unique `registrationid` that consists only of lower-case alphanumerics and hyphens):

    ```python
    from provisioningserviceclient import ProvisioningServiceClient
    from provisioningserviceclient.models import EnrollmentGroup, AttestationMechanism
    
    CONNECTION_STRING = "{dpsConnectionString}"
    
    SIGNING_CERT = """-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----"""
    
    GROUP_ID = "{registrationid}"

    def main():
        print ( "Initiating enrollment group creation..." )

        psc = ProvisioningServiceClient.create_from_connection_string(CONNECTION_STRING)
        att = AttestationMechanism.create_with_x509_signing_certs(SIGNING_CERT)
        eg = EnrollmentGroup.create(GROUP_ID, att)

        eg = psc.create_or_update(eg)
    
        print ( "Enrollment group created." )

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()
    ```

3. Save and close the **EnrollmentGroup.py** file.

:::zone-end

:::zone pivot="programming-language-java"

<a id="runjavasample"></a>

1. In the Azure IoT Java SDK, go to the sample folder *_azure-iot-sdk-java/provisioning/provisioning-samples/service-enrollment-group-sample_*.

2. Open the file *_/src/main/java/samples/com/microsoft/azure/sdk/iot/ServiceEnrollmentGroupSample.java_* in an editor of your choice.

3. Replace `[Provisioning Connection String]` with the connection string that you copied in [Get the connection string for your provisioning service](#get-the-connection-string-for-your-provisioning-service).

4. Replace the `PUBLIC_KEY_CERTIFICATE_STRING` value with the value of the *Root Cert** you generated in the previous section. Make sure to replace the entire sample value, including the lines **_-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----_** and **_-----END CERTIFICATE-----_**.

5. To configure your provisioning service from within the sample code, proceed to the next step. If you  do not want to configure it, make sure to comment out or delete the following statements in the _ServiceEnrollmentGroupSample.java_ file:

    ```Java
    enrollmentGroup.setIotHubHostName(IOTHUB_HOST_NAME);                // Optional parameter.
    enrollmentGroup.setProvisioningStatus(ProvisioningStatus.ENABLED);  // Optional parameter.
    ```

6. This step shows you how to configure your provisioning service in the sample code.

    1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

    2. On the left-hand menu or on the portal page, select **All resources**.

    3. Select your Device Provisioning Service.

    4. In the **Overview** panel, copy the hostname of the *Service endpoint*.  In the source code sample, replace `[Host name]` with the copied hostname.

        ```Java
        private static final String IOTHUB_HOST_NAME = "[Host name].azure-devices.net";
        ```

7. Study the sample code. It creates, updates, queries, and deletes a group enrollment for X.509 devices. To verify successful enrollment in portal, temporarily comment out the following lines of code at the end of the _ServiceEnrollmentGroupSample.java_ file:

    ```Java
    // ************************************** Delete info of enrollmentGroup ***************************************
    System.out.println("\nDelete the enrollmentGroup...");
    provisioningServiceClient.deleteEnrollmentGroup(enrollmentGroupId);
    ```

8. Save the file _ServiceEnrollmentGroupSample.java_.

## Modifications to enroll a single X.509 device

To enroll a single X.509 device, modify the *individual enrollment* sample code used in [Enroll TPM device to IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service using Java service SDK](quick-enroll-device-tpm.md) as follows:

1. Copy the *Common Name* of your X.509 client certificate to the clipboard. If you wish to use the _X.509 certificate generator_ tool as shown in the [preceding sample code section](#javasample), either enter a _Common Name_ for your certificate, or use the default **microsoftriotcore**. Use this **Common Name** as the value for the *REGISTRATION_ID* variable.

    ```Java
    // Use common name of your X.509 client certificate
    private static final String REGISTRATION_ID = "[RegistrationId]";
    ```

2. Rename the variable *TPM_ENDORSEMENT_KEY* as *PUBLIC_KEY_CERTIFICATE_STRING*. Copy your client certificate or the **Client Cert** from the output of the _X.509 certificate generator_ tool, as the value for the *PUBLIC_KEY_CERTIFICATE_STRING* variable.

    ```Java
    // Rename the variable *TPM_ENDORSEMENT_KEY* as *PUBLIC_KEY_CERTIFICATE_STRING*
    private static final String PUBLIC_KEY_CERTIFICATE_STRING =
            "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n" +
            "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
            "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
            "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
            "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
            "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
            "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
            "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
            "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
            "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
            "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
            "-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n";
    ```

3. In the **main** function, replace the line `Attestation attestation = new TpmAttestation(TPM_ENDORSEMENT_KEY);` with the following to use the X.509 client certificate:

    ```Java
    Attestation attestation = X509Attestation.createFromClientCertificates(PUBLIC_KEY_CERTIFICATE_STRING);
    ```

4. Save, build, and run the *individual enrollment* sample file, using the steps in the section [Create the individual enrollment sample](quick-enroll-device-tpm.md).

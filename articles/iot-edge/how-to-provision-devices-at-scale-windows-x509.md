# Create and provision IoT Edge devices at scale on Windows using X.509 certificates

[!INCLUDE [iot-edge-version-201806](../../includes/iot-edge-version-201806.md)]

This article provides end-to-end instructions for autoprovisioning one or more Windows IoT Edge devices using X.509 certificates. You can automatically provision Azure IoT Edge devices with the [Azure IoT Hub device provisioning service](../iot-dps/index.yml) (DPS). If you're unfamiliar with the process of autoprovisioning, review the [provisioning overview](../iot-dps/about-iot-dps.md#provisioning-process) before continuing.

>[!NOTE]
>Azure IoT Edge with Windows containers will not be supported starting with version 1.2 of Azure IoT Edge.
>
>Consider using the new method for running IoT Edge on Windows devices, [Azure IoT Edge for Linux on Windows](iot-edge-for-linux-on-windows.md).
>
>If you want to use Azure IoT Edge for Linux on Windows, you can follow the steps in the [equivalent how-to guide](how-to-provision-devices-at-scale-linux-on-windows-x509.md).

The tasks are as follows:

1. Generate certificates and keys.
1. Create either an **individual enrollment** for a single device or a **group enrollment** for a set of devices.
1. Install the IoT Edge runtime and register the device with IoT Hub.

Using X.509 certificates as an attestation mechanism is an excellent way to scale production and simplify device provisioning. Typically, X.509 certificates are arranged in a certificate chain of trust. Starting with a self-signed or trusted root certificate, each certificate in the chain signs the next lower certificate. This pattern creates a delegated chain of trust from the root certificate down through each intermediate certificate to the final "leaf" certificate installed on a device.

## Prerequisites

<!-- Cloud resources prerequisites H3 and content -->
[!INCLUDE [iot-edge-prerequisites-at-scale-cloud-resources.md](../../includes/iot-edge-prerequisites-at-scale-cloud-resources.md)]

### Device requirements

A physical or virtual Windows device to be the IoT Edge device.

## Generate device identity certificates

The device identity certificate is a leaf certificate that connects through a certificate chain of trust to the top X.509 certificate authority (CA) certificate. The device identity certificate must have its common name (CN) set to the device ID that you want the device to have in your IoT hub.

Device identity certificates are only used for provisioning the IoT Edge device and authenticating the device with Azure IoT Hub. They aren't signing certificates, unlike the CA certificates that the IoT Edge device presents to modules or leaf devices for verification. For more information, see [Azure IoT Edge certificate usage detail](iot-edge-certs.md).

After you create the device identity certificate, you should have two files: a .cer or .pem file that contains the public portion of the certificate, and a .cer or .pem file with the private key of the certificate. If you plan to use group enrollment in DPS, you also need the public portion of an intermediate or root CA certificate in the same certificate chain of trust.

You need the following files to set up automatic provisioning with X.509:

* The device identity certificate and its private key certificate. The device identity certificate is uploaded to DPS if you create an individual enrollment. The private key is passed to the IoT Edge runtime.
* A full chain certificate, which should have at least the device identity and the intermediate certificates in it. The full chain certificate is passed to the IoT Edge runtime.
* An intermediate or root CA certificate from the certificate chain of trust. This certificate is uploaded to DPS if you create a group enrollment.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, a limitation in libiothsm prevents the use of certificates that expire on or after January 1, 2038.

### Use test certificates (optional)

If you don't have a certificate authority available to create new identity certs and want to try out this scenario, the Azure IoT Edge git repository contains scripts that you can use to generate test certificates. These certificates are designed for development testing only, and must not be used in production.

To create test certificates, follow the steps in [Create demo certificates to test IoT Edge device features](how-to-create-test-certificates.md). Complete the two required sections to set up the certificate generation scripts and to create a root CA certificate. Then, follow the steps to create a device identity certificate. When you're finished, you should have the following certificate chain and key pair:

* `<WRKDIR>\certs\iot-edge-device-identity-<name>-full-chain.cert.pem`
* `<WRKDIR>\private\iot-edge-device-identity-<name>.key.pem`

You need both these certificates on the IoT Edge device. If you're going to use individual enrollment in DPS, then you will upload the .cert.pem file. If you're going to use group enrollment in DPS, then you also need an intermediate or root CA certificate in the same certificate chain of trust to upload. If you're using demo certs, use the `<WRKDIR>\certs\azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.cert.pem` certificate for group enrollment.

## Provision the device with its cloud identity

Once the runtime is installed on your device, configure the device with the information it uses to connect to the device provisioning service and IoT Hub.

Have the following information ready:

* The DPS **ID Scope** value. You can retrieve this value from the overview page of your DPS instance in the Azure portal.
* The device identity certificate chain file on the device.
* The device identity key file on the device.

1. Open a PowerShell window in administrator mode. Be sure to use an AMD64 session of PowerShell when installing IoT Edge, not PowerShell (x86).

1. The **Initialize-IoTEdge** command configures the IoT Edge runtime on your machine. The command defaults to manual provisioning with Windows containers, so use the `-DpsX509` flag to use automatic provisioning with X.509 certificate authentication.

   Replace the placeholder values for `scope_id`, `identity cert chain path`, and `identity key path` with the appropriate values from your DPS instance and the file paths on your device.

   Add the `-RegistrationId paste_registration_id_here` parameter if you want to set the device ID as something other than the CN name of the identity certificate.

   ```powershell
   . {Invoke-WebRequest -useb https://aka.ms/iotedge-win} | Invoke-Expression; `
   Initialize-IoTEdge -DpsX509 -ScopeId paste_scope_id_here -X509IdentityCertificate paste_identity_cert_chain_path_here -X509IdentityPrivateKey paste_identity_key_path_here
   ```

   >[!TIP]
   >The config file stores your certificate and key information as file URIs. However, the Initialize-IoTEdge command handles this formatting step for you, so you can provide the absolute path to the certificate and key files on your device.

## Verify successful installation

If the runtime started successfully, you can go into your IoT Hub and start deploying IoT Edge modules to your device.

# [Individual enrollment](#tab/individual-enrollment)

You can verify that the individual enrollment that you created in device provisioning service was used. Navigate to your device provisioning service instance in the Azure portal. Open the enrollment details for the individual enrollment that you created. Notice that the status of the enrollment is **assigned** and the device ID is listed.

# [Group enrollment](#tab/group-enrollment)

You can verify that the group enrollment that you created in device provisioning service was used. Navigate to your device provisioning service instance in the Azure portal. Open the enrollment details for the group enrollment that you created. Go to the **Registration Records** tab to view all devices registered in that group.

---

Use the following commands on your device to verify that the IoT Edge installed and started successfully.

Check the status of the IoT Edge service.

```powershell
Get-Service iotedge
```

Examine service logs.

```powershell
. {Invoke-WebRequest -useb aka.ms/iotedge-win} | Invoke-Expression; Get-IoTEdgeLog
```

List running modules.

```powershell
iotedge list
```

## Next steps

The device provisioning service enrollment process lets you set the device ID and device twin tags at the same time as you provision the new device. You can use those values to target individual devices or groups of devices using automatic device management.

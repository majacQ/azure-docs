# Configure automatic shutdown of VMs for a lab

This article shows you how you can configure automatic shutdown of VMs for a lab.

You can enable several autoshutdown cost control features to proactively prevent additional costs when the virtual machines are not being actively used. The combination of the following three automatic shutdown and disconnect features catches most of the cases where users accidentally leave their virtual machines running:
Â 
* Automatically disconnect users from virtual machines that the OS deems idle.
* Automatically shut down virtual machines when users disconnect.
* Automatically shut down virtual machines that are started but users don't connect.

Review more details about the autoshutdown features in the [Maximize cost control with autoshutdown settings](cost-management-guide.md#automatic-shutdown-settings-for-cost-control) section.

A lab account administrator can configure this setting for the lab account in which you create labs. For more information, see [Configure automatic shutdown of VMs for a lab account](how-to-configure-lab-accounts.md). As a lab owner, you can override the setting when creating a lab or after the lab is created.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Linux labs only support automatic shut down when users disconnect and when VMs are started but users don't connect.  Support also varies depending on [specific distributions and versions of Linux](../virtual-machines/extensions/diagnostics-linux.md#supported-linux-distributions).  Shutdown settings are not supported by the [Data Science Virtual Machine - Ubuntu 18.04](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/microsoft-dsvm.ubuntu-1804) image.

## Configure for the lab level

You can configure the autoshutdown setting in the [Azure Lab Services](https://labs.azure.com/).

* When creating a lab (in **Lab policies**), or
* After the lab is created (in **Settings**)

Make sure to review details about the autoshutdown in the [Maximize cost control with autoshutdown settings](cost-management-guide.md#automatic-shutdown-settings-for-cost-control) section.

> [!WARNING]
> If you shutdown the Linux or Windows operating system (OS) on a VM before disconnecting an RDP session to the VM, the autoshutdown feature will not work properly.

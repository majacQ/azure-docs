# Get more insights when load testing Azure App Service workloads

In this article, you'll learn how to gain more insights from Azure App Service workloads with Azure Load Testing Preview and App Service Diagnostics.

App Service diagnostics is an intelligent and interactive experience to help you troubleshoot your app with no configuration required. When you do run into issues with your app, App Service diagnostics points out whatâ€™s wrong to guide you to the right information to more easily and quickly troubleshoot and resolve the issue.

You can take advantage of App Service diagnostics when running load tests on application that run on Azure App Service.

## Prerequisites  

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.  
- An Azure Load Testing resource. If you need to create an Azure Load Testing resource, see the quickstart [Create and run a load test](./quickstart-create-and-run-load-test.md).
- An Azure App Service workload you're running your load test against and that you've added to the app components to monitor during the load test.

# Export test results in Azure Load Testing Preview for use in third-party tools

In this article, you'll learn how to download the test results from Azure Load Testing Preview in the Azure portal. You might use these results for reporting in third-party tools.

The test results contain a comma-separated (CSV) file with details of each application request. In addition, all files for running the Apache JMeter dashboard locally are included.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Load Testing is currently in preview.
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

## Prerequisites  

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.  
- An Azure Load Testing resource that has a completed test run. If you need to create an Azure Load Testing resource, see [Create and run a load test](./quickstart-create-and-run-load-test.md).  

## Access and download load test results

In this section, you'll retrieve and download the Azure Load Testing results file from the Azure portal.

1. Navigate to your Azure Load Testing resource in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Select **Tests** to view the list of tests, and then select your test.

   >[!TIP]
   > You can use the search box and the **Time range** filter to limit the number of tests.

1. Select **...** on the test run, and then select **Download results file**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > A test run needs to be in the **Done**, **Stopped**, or **Failed** status for the results file to be available for download.

    The browser should now start downloading the test results as a zipped folder.

1. Alternatively, you can download the test results from the test run details page. Select **Download**, and then select **Results**.

    The *testreport.csv* file contains the individual requests that the test engine executed during the load test. The Apache JMeter dashboard, which is also included in the zip file, uses this file for its graphs.

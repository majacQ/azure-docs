# Troubleshoot JMeter problems by downloading Azure Load Testing Preview logs

Learn how you can download the Azure Load Testing Preview logs in the Azure portal to troubleshoot problems with the Apache JMeter script.

When you run a load test, the Azure Load Testing test engines execute your Apache JMeter test script. The Apache JMeter log can help you to identify problems in the JMX file, as well as issues during the test execution. For example, the application endpoint might be unavailable, or the JMX file might contain invalid credentials.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Load Testing is currently in preview.
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

## Prerequisites  

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.  
- You need an Azure Load Testing resource that has a completed test run. If you need to create an Azure Load Testing resource, see [Create and run a load test](./quickstart-create-and-run-load-test.md).  

## Access and download logs for your load test  

In this section, you'll retrieve and download the Azure Load Testing logs from the Azure portal.

1. Navigate to your Azure Load Testing resource in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Select **Tests** to view the list of tests, and then select your test.

# Tutorial: Identify performance regressions with Azure Pipelines and Azure Load Testing Preview

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to automate performance regression testing with Azure Load Testing Preview and Azure Pipelines. You'll configure an Azure Pipelines CI/CD workflow to run a load test for a sample web application, and then use the results to identify performance regressions.

If you're using GitHub Actions for your CI/CD workflows, see the corresponding [GitHub Actions tutorial](./tutorial-cicd-github-actions.md).

You'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Set up your repository with files required for load testing.
> * Set up Azure Pipelines to integrate with Azure Load Testing.
> * Run the load test and view results in the pipeline logs.
> * Define pass/fail criteria for the load test.
> * Parameterize the load test using pipeline variables.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Load Testing is currently in PREVIEW.
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Pipelines has a 60-minute timeout on jobs that are running on Microsoft-hosted agents for private projects. If your load test is running for more than 60 minutes, you'll need to pay for [additional capacity](/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/hosted?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#capabilities-and-limitations). If not, the pipeline will time out without waiting for the test results. You can view the load test status in the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.  
* An Azure DevOps organization and project. If you don't have an Azure DevOps organization, you can [create one for free](/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/pipelines-sign-up.md?view=azure-devops&preserve-view=true). If you need help with getting started with Azure Pipelines, see [Create your first pipeline](/azure/devops/pipelines/create-first-pipeline.md?preserve-view=true&view=azure-devops&tabs=java%2Ctfs-2018-2%2Cbrowser).
* A GitHub account, where you can create a repository. If you don't have one, you can [create one for free](https://github.com/).  
* An existing Azure Load Testing resource. To create a Load Testing resource, see [Create and run a load test](./quickstart-create-and-run-load-test.md#create_resource).

## Set up your repository

To get started, you first need a GitHub repository with the sample web application. You'll then use this repository to configure an Azure Pipelines workflow to run the load test.

1. Open a browser and navigate to the sample application's source GitHub repository: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/nodejs-appsvc-cosmosdb-bottleneck.git

    The sample application is a Node.js app consisting of an Azure App Service web component and a Cosmos DB database.

1. Select **Fork** to fork the sample application repository to your GitHub account.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-cicd-azure-pipelines/fork-github-repo.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to fork the sample application GitHub repo.":::

## Configure the Apache JMeter script

The sample application's source repo includes an Apache JMeter script named *SampleApp.jmx*. This script carries out three API calls on each test iteration:

* `add` - Carries out a data insert operation on Cosmos DB for the number of visitors on the webapp.
* `get` - Carries out a GET operation from Cosmos DB to retrieve the count.
* `lasttimestamp` - Updates the timestamp since the last user went to the website.

In this section, you'll update the Apache JMeter script with the URL of your sample web app.
 
1. In your sample application repository, open *SampleApp.jmx* for editing.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-cicd-azure-pipelines/edit-jmx.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to edit the Apache JMeter test script.":::

1. Search for `<stringProp name="HTTPSampler.domain">`.

   You'll see three instances of `<stringProp name="HTTPSampler.domain">` in the file.

1. Replace the value with the URL of your sample application's App Service in all three instances. 

   ```xml
   <stringProp name="HTTPSampler.domain">{your-app-name}.azurewebsites.net</stringProp>
   ```

    You'll deploy the sample application to an Azure App Service web app by using Azure Pipelines in the subsequent steps. For now, replace the placeholder text *`{your-app-name}`* in the previous previous XML snippet with a unique name you wish to provide to the App Service web app. You'll then use this same name to create the web app.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Don't include `https` or `http` in the sample application's URL.

1. Commit your changes to the main branch.

## Set up Azure Pipelines access permissions for Azure

In this section, you'll configure your Azure DevOps project to have permissions to access the Azure Load Testing resource.

To access Azure resources, you'll create a service connection in Azure DevOps and use role-based access control to assign the necessary permissions.

1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization (*`https://dev.azure.com/<yourorganization>`*).

1. Select **Project settings** > **Service connections**.

1. Select **+ New service connection**, select the **Azure Resource Manager** service connection, and then select **Next**.

1. Select the **Service Principal (automatic)** authentication method, and then select **Next**.

1. Select the **Subscription** scope level and then select your Azure subscription that contains your Azure Load Testing resource.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-cicd-azure-pipelines/new-service-connection.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to create a new service connection.":::

    You'll use the name of the service connection in a later step to configure the pipeline.

1. Select **Save** to create the connection.

1. Select the service connection from the list, and then select **Manage Service Principal**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-cicd-azure-pipelines/manage-service-principal.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to manage a service principal.":::

    You'll see the details of the service principal in the Azure portal. Note the service principal **Application (Client) ID**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-cicd-azure-pipelines/service-connection-object-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to get the service connection application ID.":::
    
1. Now, assign the **Load Test Contributor** role to the service principal to allow access to the Azure Load Testing service.

    First, retrieve the service principal object ID. Select the **objectId** result from the following Azure CLI command:

    ```azurecli
    az ad sp show --id "<application-client-id>"
    ```
    
    Replace the placeholder text *`<sp-object-id>`* with the service principal object ID. Also, replace the *`<subscription-name-or-id>`* with your Azure subscription ID.

    ```azurecli
    az role assignment create --assignee "<sp-object-id>" \
        --role "Load Test Contributor" \
        --subscription "<subscription-name-or-id>"
    ```

## Configure the Azure Pipelines workflow to run a load test

In this section, you'll set up an Azure Pipelines workflow that triggers the load test.

First, you'll install the Azure Load Testing extension from the Azure DevOps Marketplace, create a new pipeline, and then connect it to the sample application's forked repository.

1. Install the Azure Load Testing task extension from the Azure DevOps Marketplace.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-cicd-azure-pipelines/browse-marketplace.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to browse the Visual Studio Marketplace for extensions.":::
    
    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-cicd-azure-pipelines/marketplace-load-testing-extension.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to install the Azure Load Testing extension from the Visual Studio Marketplace.":::

1. In your Azure DevOps project, select **Pipelines**, and then select **Create pipeline**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-cicd-azure-pipelines/create-pipeline.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to create a new Azure Pipeline.":::

1. In the **Connect** tab, select **GitHub**.

1. Select **Authorize AzurePipelines** to allow Azure Pipelines to access your GitHub account for triggering workflows.

1. In the **Select** tab, select the sample application's forked repository.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-cicd-azure-pipelines/create-pipeline-select-repo.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to select the sample application's GitHub repository.":::

    The repository contains an *azure-pipeline.yml* pipeline definition file. You'll now modify this definition to connect to your Azure Load Testing service.

1. In the **Review** tab, replace the following placeholder texts in the YAML code.

    |Placeholder  |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |*`<Name of your webapp>`*     | The Azure App Service web app name. This name should match the name used for the endpoint URL in the *SampleApp.jmx* test script. |
    | *`<Name of your webARM Service connection>`* | The name of the service connection you created in the previous section. |
    |*`<Azure subscriptionId>`*     | Your Azure subscription ID. |
    |*`<Name of your load test resource>`*     | The name of your Azure Load Testing resource. |
    |*`<Name of your load test resource group>`*     | The resource group name that contains the Azure Load Testing resource. |
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The name of Azure web app should match the name you used for the endpoint URL in the *SampleApp.jmx* test script.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-cicd-azure-pipelines/create-pipeline-review.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Azure Pipelines Review tab when creating a pipeline.":::

1. Select **Save and run**, enter a **Commit message**, and then select **Save and run**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-cicd-azure-pipelines/create-pipeline-save.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to save and run a new Azure Pipeline.":::

    Azure Pipelines now runs the CI/CD workflow. You can monitor the status and logs by selecting the pipeline job.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-cicd-azure-pipelines/create-pipeline-status.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to view pipeline job details.":::

## View load test results

 For every update to the main branch, the Azure pipeline executes the following steps:

- Deploy the sample Node.js application to an Azure App Services web app. The name of the web app is configured in the pipeline definition.
- Trigger Azure Load Testing to create and run the load test, based on the Apache JMeter script and the test configuration YAML file in the repository.

In this section, you'll view the load test results in the pipeline log information.

1. In your Azure DevOps project, select **Pipelines**, and then select your pipeline definition from the list.

1. Select the pipeline run to view the run summary.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-cicd-azure-pipelines/create-pipeline-run-summary.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the pipeline run summary.":::

1. Select **Load Test** in the **Jobs** section to view the pipeline logs.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-cicd-azure-pipelines/create-pipeline-log.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Azure Pipeline run log.":::

    Once the load test finishes, you can view the test summary information and the client-side metrics in the pipeline logs. The log also shows the URL to navigate to the Azure Load Testing dashboard for this load test.

2. In the pipeline log view, select **Load Test**, and then select **1 artifact produced** to download the load test result files.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-cicd-azure-pipelines/create-pipeline-download-results.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to download the load test results.":::

## Define test pass/fail criteria

In this section, you'll add failure criteria to determine the outcome of your load test. If at least one of the failure criteria evaluates to true, the load test is unsuccessful.

You can specify these criteria in the test configuration YAML file.

1. Edit the *SampleApp.yml* file in your GitHub repository.  

1. Add the following snippet at the end of the file.

    ```yaml
    failureCriteria: 
        - avg(response_time_ms) > 100
        - percentage(error) > 20
    ```

    You've now specified failure criteria for your load test. The test will fail if at least one of these conditions is met:
    
    - The aggregate average response time is greater than 100 ms.    
    - The aggregate percentage of errors is greater than 20%.

1. Commit and push the changes to the main branch of the repository.
    
    The changes will trigger the Azure Pipelines CI/CD workflow.

1. In the pipeline runs page, select the most recent entry from the list.

    After the load test finishes, you'll notice that the pipeline failed because the average response time was higher than you specified in the failure criteria.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-cicd-azure-pipelines/test-criteria-failed.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows pipeline logs after a failed test criteria.":::

    The Azure Load Testing service evaluates the criteria during the test execution. If any of these conditions fails, Azure Load Testing service returns a non-zero exit code. This code informs the CI/CD workflow that the test has failed.

1. Edit the *SampleApp.yml* file and change the test failure criteria.

    ```yaml
    failureCriteria: 
        - avg(response_time_ms) > 5000
        - percentage(error) > 20
    ```
    
1. Commit the changes to trigger the Azure Pipelines CI/CD workflow. 
    
    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-cicd-azure-pipelines/test-criteria-passed.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows pipeline logs after all test criteria pass.":::

    The load test now succeeds and the pipeline finishes successfully.

## Pass parameters to your load tests from the pipeline

Next, you'll parameterize your load test using pipeline variables. These variables can be secrets, such as passwords, or non-secrets.

In this tutorial, you'll reconfigure the sample application to only accept secure requests. To send a secure request, you'll need to pass a secret value in the HTTP request.

1. Edit the *SampleApp.yaml* file in your GitHub repository.

    Update the **testPlan** configuration setting to use the *SampleApp_Secrets.jmx* file.

    ```yml
    version: v0.1
    testName: SampleApp
    testPlan: SampleApp_Secrets.jmx
    description: 'SampleApp Test with secrets'
    engineInstances: 1
    ```

    The *SampleApp_Secrets.jmx* Apache JMeter script uses a user-defined variable that retrieves the secret value with the custom function `${__GetSecret(secretName)}`. Apache JMeter then passes this secret value to the sample application endpoint.

1. Commit the changes to the YAML file.

1. Edit the *config.json* file in your GitHub repository.
    
    Update the `enableSecretsFeature` setting to **true** to reconfigure the sample application to only accept secure requests.
    
    ```json
    {
        "enableSecretsFeature": true
    }
    ```
    
1. Commit the changes to the *config.json* file.

1. Edit the *SampleApp_Secrets.jmx* file.

1. Search for `<stringProp name="HTTPSampler.domain">`.

   You'll see three instances of `<stringProp name="HTTPSampler.domain">` in the file.

1. Replace the value with the URL of your sample application's App Service in all three instances. 

   ```xml
   <stringProp name="HTTPSampler.domain">{your-app-name}.azurewebsites.net</stringProp>
   ```

    You'll deploy the sample application to an Azure App Service web app by using the GitHub Actions workflow. In the previous XML snippet, replace the placeholder text *`{your-app-name}`* with the unique name of the App Service web app.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Don't include `https` or `http` in the sample application's URL.

1. Save and commit the Apache JMeter script.

1. Go to the **Pipelines** page, select your pipeline definition, and then select **Edit**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-cicd-azure-pipelines/edit-pipeline.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to edit a pipeline definition.":::

1. Select **Variables**, and then select **New variable**.

1. Enter the **Name** (*mySecret*) and **Value** (*1797669089*) information, and then check the **Keep this value secret** box to store the variable securely. 

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-cicd-azure-pipelines/new-variable.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to create a new pipeline variable.":::

1. Select **OK**, and then select **Save** to save the new variable.

1. Edit the *azure-pipeline.yml* file to pass the secret to the load test.

    Edit the Azure Load Testing task by adding the following YAML snippet:

    ```yml
    secrets: |
      [
          {
          "name": "appToken",
          "value": "$(mySecret)"
          }
      ]
    ```

1. Save and run the pipeline.  

    The Azure Load Testing task securely passes the secret from the pipeline to the test engine. The secret parameter is only used while running the load test, and then the value is discarded from memory.
    
Take a look at the overview of the Azure Load Testing task in the next section.  

## Azure Load Testing Task

This section describes the Azure Load Testing task for Azure Pipelines. The task is cross-platform, and runs on Windows, Linux, or Mac agents.

You can use the following parameters to configure the Azure Load Testing task.

|Parameter  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|`azureSubscription`     |  **Required** Name of the Azure Resource Manager service connection.       |
|`loadTestConfigFile`     | **Required** Path to the load test YAML configuration file. The path is fully qualified or relative to the default working directory.        |
|`resourceGroup`     |  **Required** Name of the resource group that contains the Azure Load Testing resource.       |
|`loadTestResource`     |   **Required** Name of an existing Azure Load Testing resource.      |
|`secrets`     |   Array of JSON objects that consist of the **name** and **value** for each secret. The name should match the secret name used in the Apache JMeter test script. |
|`env`     |   Array of JSON objects that consist of the **name** and **value** for each environment variable. The name should match the variable name used in the Apache JMeter test script. |

The following YAML code snippet describes how to use the task in an Azure Pipelines CI/CD workflow.

```yaml
- task: AzureLoadTest@1
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: '<Azure service connection>'
    loadTestConfigFile: '< YAML File path>'
    loadTestResource: '<name of the load test resource>'
    resourceGroup: '<name of the resource group of your load test resource>' 
    secrets: |
      [
          {
          "name": "<Name of the secret>",
          "value": "$(mySecret1)",
          },
          {
          "name": "<Name of the secret>",
          "value": "$(mySecret1)",
          }
      ]
    env: |
      [
          {
          "name": "<Name of the variable>",
          "value": "<Value of the variable>",
          },
          {
          "name": "<Name of the variable>",
          "value": "<Value of the variable>",
          }
      ]
```

# Resell your offer through CSP

Enabling this option allows partners who are part of the Microsoft Cloud Solution Providers (CSP) program to resell your VM as part of a bundled offer. All Bring-your-own-license (BYOL) plans are automatically opted into the program. You can also choose to opt in your non-BYOL plans. For more information, see [Cloud Solution Provider program](cloud-solution-providers.md).

## Resell through CSP

On the **Resell through CSPs** page of your offer, you can expand the reach of your offer by making it available to partners in the [Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0145p/) program.

1. Select which partners can resell your offer:

    - Any partner in the CSP program
    - Specific partners in the CSP program I select
    - No partners in the CSP program

1. Select **Save draft** before continuing.
1. If you chose to offer a test drive with this offer, in the left-nav menu, select **Test drive**. Otherwise, select **Review and publish**.

## Next steps

- [Configure a VM test drive](azure-vm-test-drive.md). This optional feature is only available if you selected the **Test drive** check box on the [Offer setup](azure-vm-offer-setup.md#test-drive-optional) page.
- If you don't want to set up a test drive, it's time to [review and publish your offer](review-publish-offer.md).

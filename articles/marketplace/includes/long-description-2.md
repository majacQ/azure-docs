Here are some tips for writing an informative and impactful description:

- Clearly describe the value of your offer in the first few sentences. Keep in mind that the first few sentences might be displayed in search results.
- Focus on the value your offer provides. Don't rely on features and functionality to sell your product.
- Use industry-specific vocabulary and language that describes the benefits of your offer.
- Use HTML tags to format your description so it's more engaging. For a list of allowed tags, see [Supported HTML tags](../supported-html-tags.md).

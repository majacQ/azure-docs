title: Common questions about configuring Independent Software Vendor (ISV) to Cloud Reseller private offers
summary: This article covers questions about configuring Independent Software Vendor (ISV) to Cloud Reseller private offers.


sections:
  - name: Setting up a private offer
    questions:
      - question: For what offer types can ISVs extend a private offer?
        answer: |
          The offer must be transactable and opted in for selling through the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) channel. This applies to both license-based and consumption-based offer types.

      - question: Does a CSP Partner negotiate a margin with an ISV or does the ISV just apply a blanket margin to all CSP Partners?
        answer: |
          ISVs and CSP Partners should negotiate the margin. ISVs can also provide a margin without consulting with a CSP Partner. There is a limit of 400 CSP tenants per offer. 

      - question: What is the duration of the private offer? Is it the same as the offer term?
        answer: |
          Each private offer has a start and end date. For offer types with monthly billing and term, the margin applies until the end date of the private offer. At the next billing event after the end date of the private offer, the CSP partner will be charged at the price without margin unless the ISV has created a new private offer for that offer and CSP partner.

          For Annual term (annual billing), the CSP will be charged at the price with margin applied if the billing event occurs during the term of the private offer.

          There are currently no monthly billing, annual term offers.

      - question: Can the ISV apply the margin at the customer level or only at the CSP Partner level?
        answer: |
          The margin is applied at the CSP Partner tenant level. The CSP partner will receive a margin for any transaction they make for any customer. Applying a margin at the customer level (customer of a CSP Partner) is under consideration for a future phase.

      - question: Does the ISV have to create a private offer in each region?
        answer: |
          No. When an ISV publishes an offer, they choose which countries the offer can be sold in. When an ISV creates a private offer for a CSP partner, they can choose CSP tenants from any region in the same private offer. 

      - question: Can an ISV provide different margin percentages to different CSP Partners?
        answer: |
          Yes, the ISV can configure a margin at the offer/plan level per CSP Partner. Different percentage margins require separate private offers.

      - question: Once created, how long does it take for a private offer to become active?
        answer: |
           It depends. If the offer has been opted in and the CSP partner has already been selected by the ISV to sell their offer, the change will be almost immediate (within 15 minutes). There may be a longer wait time (up to six hours) if the offer needs to be opted in to be sold via CSP or if the CSP Partner needs to be authorized to sell the ISV’s offer.

      - question: What happens if an ISV tries to provide a margin to a CSP partner they have not opted in or an offer they have not opted in to sell via CSP? 
        answer: |
          Creating a private offer for a CSP who you have not selected to sell your offer will automatically enable that CSP to be able to sell your offer. Similarly, if an offer has not been opted in to be sold via CSP and the ISV creates a margin for a CSP, that offer will be opted into CSP to be sold via that CSP only (not All CSPs).

      - question: If an ISV searches for but can't find a partner to provide a margin to, can they be added?
        answer: |
          No. Partners must be part of Microsoft's CSP program and need to be a Direct CSP or Indirect provider to be provided a margin. If a partner does not return in the search, it is likely they are either not part of Microsoft’s CSP program or they are an indirect reseller. CSP partners can review information on how to enroll in the program at [Enroll in the Cloud Solution Provider program](/partner-center/enrolling-in-the-csp-program).

      - question: If an ISV works with an indirect reseller who purchases through a Distributor/Indirect provider, how can an ISV sell their offer via the Indirect Reseller?
        answer: |
          The ISV will need to select the Indirect Provider who the Indirect reseller purchases from and the Indirect Provider will have to choose whether to sell the ISV’s offer via their indirect resellers.

          An ISV cannot provide a margin/private offer to an indirect reseller directly but the indirect provider may decide to pass a margin through to their indirect reseller.

      - question: If an ISV has opted in to sell to all CSP partners, can they provide a margin to only a select group of CSP partners?
        answer: |
          Yes. There is a limit of 400 CSP tenants per offer.

      - question: If an ISV chooses to add a margin at the offer level, does it include all plans underneath the offer?
        answer: |
          Yes, all existing and future plans under the offer selected will be included.

      - question: What partner types does the limit of 400 CSP tenants apply to?
        answer: |
          This limit applies to the number of Indirect Provider and Direct Bill CSP partner tenants. If an Indirect provider has thousands of indirect resellers, those tenants do not apply towards the limit total. 

  - name: Editing a private offer
    questions:
      - question: What if an ISV wants to change the term of a private offer?
        answer: |
          Once an ISV has extended a private offer, they can't alter the term of the private offer prior to the end date, nor change the end date. Once the CSP Partner receives a private offer, it is locked in until its end date.

          If the ISV adds a new private offer providing the CSP Partner a greater margin percentage and the timeline overlaps the current offer, the higher margin percentage will apply.

      - question: Can a private offer be canceled?
        answer: |
          An ISV will be able to request to cancel/withdraw a private offer. If the CSP partner has not yet transacted the offer, this request will be approved.

          If the CSP partner has transacted it for their customer, the ISV won’t be able to cancel the private offer prior to the end of the term.

      - question: If the ISV made a mistake and created a private offer with the incorrect margin percentage, can they edit it?
        answer: |
          Once the private offer has been submitted, it cannot be edited until the end of the term. The ISV can only request to cancel (via withdraw request) the original private offer if the CSP partner has not yet transacted the offer.

      - question: Can an ISV remove a CSP partner from an existing private offer?
        answer: |
          No, an ISV can't remove a CSP partner if the partner has transacted an offer.

          If no partner has transacted an offer from the original private offer, the ISV can create a new private offer excluding the CSP they wish to remove. They will then need to cancel the original private offer. 

          If another CSP partner from the private offer has transacted the offer but the CSP to be removed has not, the ISV can create a new private offer without the CSP they wish to remove. They can then cancel the original private offer via the withdraw functionality. 

      - question: Can the ISV add more partners to an existing private offer?
        answer: |
          No. The ISV will need to create a new private offer to add a new CSP partner.

      - question: How can an ISV extend the end date of an existing private offer?
        answer: |
          The end date of an existing private offer can't be extended. The ISV partner should create a new private offer. 

  - name: Post-purchase
    questions:
      - question: If there are associated Azure consumption charges, does the margin also apply to those charges?
        answer: |
          No, the margin only applies to the price of the software set by the ISV for their product, not to the associated Azure consumption charges.

      - question: What happens if the CSP partner increases seats for a customer with an annual subscription after a private offer has expired?
        answer: |
          *Annual subscriptions only apply to entitlement-based offers*.

          The newly added seats will still get the discounted price as they purchased the subscription during the original private offer term. It continues until the end of the annual subscription term. 

          If the CSP partner increases seats for offers with metered billing, the pricing for the entitlement-based portion of the charges will maintain the discount until the end of the annual subscription term but the margin applied to the price for the metered billing will not be maintained after the end period of the private offer. The workaround here is for ISVs to create a new private offer for that CSP partner until the end of the subscription term.

          The same concept applies for monthly subscriptions (and billing). If a private offer ends in a month, the CSP partner will be charged at the full price the following month.

          The end date for a private offer is always the end of the month.

      - question: How will payout reporting be affected by margin? 
        answer: |
          There will be no changes to the representation of payout reporting. The payout amount and agency fee that Microsoft charges will be based on the price after margin is applied for line items that have associated margin.

# SaaS fulfillment operations APIs v2 in the Microsoft commercial marketplace

This article describes version 2 of the SaaS fulfillment operations APIs.

## List outstanding operations

Get list of the pending operations for the specified SaaS subscription. The publisher should acknowledge returned operations by calling the [Operation Patch API](#update-the-status-of-an-operation).

### Get `https://marketplaceapi.microsoft.com/api/saas/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/operations?api-version=<ApiVersion>`

*Query parameters:*

|  Parameter         | Value             |
|  ---------------   |  ---------------  |
|    `ApiVersion`    |  Use 2018-08-31.         |
|    `subscriptionId` | The unique identifier of the purchased SaaS subscription.  This ID is obtained after resolving the commercial marketplace authorization token by using the Resolve API.  |

*Request headers:*
 
|  Parameter         | Value             |
|  ---------------   |  ---------------  |
|  `content-type`     |  `application/json` |
|  `x-ms-requestid`    |  A unique string value for tracking the request from the client, preferably a GUID.  If this value isn't provided, one will be generated and provided in the response headers.  |
|  `x-ms-correlationid` |  A unique string value for operation on the client.  This parameter correlates all events from client operation with events on the server side.  If this value isn't provided, one will be generated and provided in the response headers.  |
|  `authorization`     |  The format is `"Bearer <access_token>"` when the token value is retrieved by the publisher as explained in [Get a token based on the Azure AD app](./pc-saas-registration.md#get-the-token-with-an-http-post).  |

*Response codes:*

Code: 200
Returns pending operations on the specified SaaS subscription.

*Response payload example:*

```json
{
  "operations": [
    {
      "id": "<guid>", //Operation ID, should be provided in the operations patch API call
      "activityId": "<guid>", //not relevant
      "subscriptionId": "<guid>", // subscriptionId of the SaaS subscription that is being reinstated
      "offerId": "offer1", // purchased offer ID
      "publisherId": "contoso",
      "planId": "silver", // purchased plan ID
      "quantity": "20", // purchased amount of seats, will be empty is not relevant
      "action": "Reinstate",
      "timeStamp": "2018-12-01T00:00:00", // UTC
      "status": "InProgress" // the only status that can be returned in this case
    }
  ]
}
```

Returns empty json if no operations are pending.

Code: 400
Bad request: validation failures.

Code: 403
Forbidden. The authorization token is invalid, expired, or was not provided. The request is attempting to access a SaaS subscription for an offer that's published with a different Azure AD app ID from the one used to create the authorization token.

This error is often a symptom of not performing the [SaaS registration](pc-saas-registration.md) correctly.

Code: 404
Not found.  The SaaS subscription with `subscriptionId` is not found.

Code: 500
Internal server error. Retry the API call.  If the error persists, contact [Microsoft support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2165533).

## Get operation status

This API enables the publisher to track the status of the specified async operation:  **Unsubscribe**, **ChangePlan**, or **ChangeQuantity**.

The `operationId` for this API call can be retrieved from the value returned by **Operation-Location**, the get pending Operations API call, or the `<id>` parameter value received in a webhook call.

|  `x-ms-requestid`    |  A unique string value for tracking the request from the client, preferably a GUID.  If this value isn't provided, one will be generated and provided in the response headers. |
|  `x-ms-correlationid` |  A unique string value for operation on the client.  This parameter correlates all events from client operation with events on the server side.  If this value isn't provided, one will be generated and provided in the response headers.  |
|  `authorization`     |  A unique access token that identifies the publisher making this API call.  The format is `"Bearer <access_token>"` when the token value is retrieved by the publisher as explained in [Get a token based on the Azure AD app](./pc-saas-registration.md#get-the-token-with-an-http-post).  |

# Create a Power BI app offer

This article describes how to create a Power BI app offer. All offers go through our certification process, which checks your solution for standard requirements, compatibility, and proper practices.

Before you start, create a commercial marketplace account in [Partner Center](./create-account.md) and ensure it is enrolled in the commercial marketplace program.

## Before you begin

Review [Plan a Power BI offer](marketplace-power-bi.md). It will explain the technical requirements for this offer and list the information and assets youâ€™ll need when you create it.

## Create a new offer

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2166002).

1. On the Home page, select the **Marketplace offers** tile.

    [ ![Illustrates the Marketplace offers tile on the Partner Center Home page.](./media/workspaces/partner-center-home.png) ](./media/workspaces/partner-center-home.png#lightbox)

1. On the Marketplace offers page, select **+ New offer** > **Power BI app**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After an offer is published, any edits you make to it in Partner Center appear on Microsoft AppSource only after you republish the offer. Be sure to always republish an offer after changing it.

If **Power BI App** isn't shown or enabled, your account doesn't have permission to create this offer type. Please check that you've met all the [requirements](./marketplace-dynamics-365.md) for this offer type, including registering for a developer account.

## New offer

Enter an **Offer ID**. This is a unique identifier for each offer in your account.

- This ID is visible to customers in the web address for the offer and in Azure Resource Manager templates, if applicable.
- Use only lowercase letters and numbers. The ID can include hyphens and underscores, but no spaces, and is limited to 50 characters. For example, if your Publisher ID is `testpublisherid` and you enter **test-offer-1**, the offer web address will be `https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-365/testpublisherid.test-offer-1`.
- The Offer ID can't be changed after you select **Create**.

Enter an **Offer alias**. This is the name used for the offer in Partner Center.

- This name isn't used on AppSource. It is different from the offer name and other values shown to customers.
- This name can't be changed after you select **Create**.

Select **Create** to generate the offer. Partner Center opens the **Offer setup** page.

## Alias

Enter a descriptive name that we'll use to refer to this offer solely within Partner Center. The offer alias (pre-populated with what you entered when you created the offer) won't be used in the marketplace and is different than the offer name shown to customers. If you want to update the offer name later, see the [Offer listing](power-bi-app-offer-listing.md) page.

## Setup details

This section is blank and not applicable to Power BI apps.

## Customer leads

[!INCLUDE [Connect lead management](includes/customer-leads.md)]

For more information, see [Customer leads from your commercial marketplace offer](partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-get-customer-leads.md).

Select **Save draft** before continuing to the next tab in the left-nav menu, **Properties**.

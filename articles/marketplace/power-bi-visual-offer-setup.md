# Create a Power BI visual offer

This article describes how to use Partner Center to submit a Power BI visual offer to [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com) for others to discover and use.

Before you start, create a commercial marketplace account in [Partner Center](./create-account.md) and ensure it is enrolled in the commercial marketplace program.

## Before you begin

Review [Plan a Power BI visual offer](marketplace-power-bi-visual.md). It will explain the technical requirements for this offer and list the information and assets youâ€™ll need when you create it.

## Create a new offer

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home).

1. On the Home page, select the **Marketplace offers** tile.

    [ ![Illustrates the Marketplace offers tile on the Partner Center Home page.](./media/workspaces/partner-center-home.png) ](./media/workspaces/partner-center-home.png#lightbox)

1. On the Marketplace offers page, select **+ New offer** > **Power BI visual**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After an offer is published, any edits you make to it in Partner Center appear in AppSource only after you republish the offer. Be sure to always republish an offer after changing it.

## New offer

Enter an **Offer ID**. This is a unique identifier for each offer in your account.

- This ID is visible to customers in the web address for the offer and in Azure Resource Manager templates, if applicable.
- Use only lowercase letters and numbers. The ID can include hyphens and underscores, but no spaces, and is limited to 50 characters. For example, if your Publisher ID is `testpublisherid` and you enter **test-offer-1**, the offer web address will be `https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-365/testpublisherid.test-offer-1`.
- The Offer ID can't be changed after you select **Create**.
- The Offer ID should be unique within the list of all other Power BI visual offers in Partner Center.

Enter an **Offer alias**. This is the name used for the offer in Partner Center.

- This name isn't used in AppSource. It is different from the offer name and other values shown to customers.

Select **Create** to generate the offer. Partner Center opens the **Offer setup** page.

## Setup details

For **Additional purchases**, select whether or not your offer requires purchases of a service or additional in-app purchases.

For **Power BI certification** (optional), read the description carefully and if you want to request Power BI certification, select the check box. [Certified](/power-bi/developer/visuals/power-bi-custom-visuals-certified) Power BI visuals meet certain specified code requirements that the Microsoft Power BI team has tested and approved. We recommend that you submit and publish your Power BI visual *before* you request certification, because the certification process takes extra time that could delay publishing of your offer.

## Customer leads

[!INCLUDE [Connect lead management](includes/customer-leads.md)]

Connecting to a CRM is optional. For more information, see [Customer leads from your commercial marketplace offer](partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-get-customer-leads.md).

Select **Save draft** before continuing to the next tab in the left-nav menu, **Properties**.

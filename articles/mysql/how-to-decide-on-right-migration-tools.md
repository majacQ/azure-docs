# Select the right tools for migration to Azure Database for MySQL

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-mysql-single-flexible-server](includes/applies-to-mysql-single-flexible-server.md)]

## Overview

Migrations are multi-step projects that are tough to pull off. Migrating database servers across platforms involves more than data and schema migration. There are also several other components, such as server configuration parameters, networking, access control rules, etc., to move. These are required to ensure that the functionality of the database server in the new target platform mimics the source. 

For detailed information and use cases about migrating databases to Azure Database for MySQL, you can refer to the [Database Migration Guide](migrate/mysql-on-premises-azure-db/01-mysql-migration-guide-intro.md). This document provides pointers that will help you successfully plan and execute a MySQL migration to Azure. 

In general, migrations can be categorized as either offline or online. 

- With an offline migration, the source server is taken offline and a dump and restore of the databases is performed on the target server. 

- With an online migration (migration with minimal downtime), the source server allows updates, and the migration solution will take care of replicating the ongoing changes between the source and target server along with the initial dump and restore on the target. 

If your application can afford some downtime, offline migrations are always the preferred choice, as they are simple and easy to execute. However, if your application can only afford minimal downtime, an online migration is the best choice. Migrations of the majority of OLTP systems, such as payment processing and e-commerce, fall into this category. 

## Decision table

To help you with selecting the right tools for migrating to Azure Database for MySQL, consider the detail in the following table.

A network security group (NSG) enables you to filter inbound traffic to, and outbound traffic from, a virtual machine (VM). You can log network traffic that flows through an NSG with Network Watcher's NSG flow log capability.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a VM with a network security group
> * Enable Network Watcher and register the Microsoft.Insights provider
> * Enable a traffic flow log for an NSG, using Network Watcher's NSG flow log capability
> * Download logged data
> * View logged data
## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

## Create a virtual machine

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Virtual machine**. Select **Virtual machines**.

3. In **Virtual machines**, select **+ Create** then **+ Virtual machine**.

4. Enter or select the following information in **Create a virtual machine**.

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | **Project details** |   |
    | Subscription | Select your subscription. |
    | Resource group | Select **Create new**. </br> Enter **myResourceGroup** in **Name**. </br> Select **OK**. | 
    | **Instance details** |   |
    | Virtual machine name | Enter **myVM**. |
    | Region | Select **(US) East US**. |
    | Availability options | Select **No infrastructure redundancy required**. |
    | Security type | Leave the default of **Standard**. |
    | Image | Select **Windows Server 2022 Datacenter: Azure Edition - Gen2**. |
    | Azure Spot instance | Leave the default. |
    | Size | Select a size. |
    | **Administrator account** |   |
    | Authentication type | Select **SSH public key**. |
    | Username | Enter a username. |
    | Password | Enter a password. |
    | Confirm password | Confirm password. |
    | **Inbound port rules** |   |
    | Public inbound ports | Leave the default of **Allow selected ports**. |
    | Select inbound ports | Leave the default of **RDP (3389)**. |

5. Select **Review + create**. 

6. Select **Create**.

The virtual machine takes a few minutes to create. Don't continue with remaining steps until the VM has finished creating. While the portal creates the virtual machine, it also creates a network security group with the name **myVM-nsg**, and associates it to the network interface for the VM.

## Enable Network Watcher

If you already have a network watcher enabled in the East US region, skip to [Register Insights provider](#register-insights-provider).

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Network Watcher**. Select **Network Watcher** in the search results.

2. In the **Overview** page of **Network Watcher**, select **+ Add**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-portal/enable-network-watcher.png" alt-text="Screenshot of enable network watcher in portal.":::

3. Select your subscription in **Add network watcher**. Select **(US) East US** in **Region**.

4. Select **Add**.

## Register Insights provider

NSG flow logging requires the **Microsoft.Insights** provider. To register the provider, complete the following steps:

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Subscriptions**. Select **Subscriptions** in the search results.

2. Select the subscription you want to enable the provider for in **Subscriptions**.

3. Select **Resource providers** in **Settings** of your subscription.

4. Enter **Microsoft.Insights** in the filter box.

5. Confirm the status of the provider displayed is **Registered**. If the status is **Unregistered**, select the provider then select **Register**.

## Enable NSG flow log

NSG flow log data is written to an Azure Storage account. Complete the following steps to create a storage account for the log data.

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Storage account**. Select **Storage accounts** in the search results.

2. In **Storage accounts**, select **+ Create**.

3. Enter or select the following information in **Create a storage account**.

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | **Project details** |   |
    | Subscription | Select your subscription. |
    | Resource group | Select **myResourceGroup**. |
    | **Instance details** |   |
    | Storage account name | Enter a name for your storage account. </br> Must be 3-24 characters in length, can only contain lowercase letters and numbers, and must be unique across all Azure Storage. |
    | Region | Select **(US)East US**. |
    | Performance | Leave the default of **Standard**. |
    | Redundancy | Leave the default of **Geo-redundant storage (GRS)**. |

4. Select **Review + create**.

5. Select **Create**.

The storage account may take around minute to create. Don't continue with remaining steps until the storage account is created. In all cases, the storage account must be in the same region as the NSG.

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Network Watcher**. Select **Network Watcher** in the search results.

2. Select **NSG flow logs** in **Logs**.

3. In **Network Watcher | NSG flow logs**, select **+ Create**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-portal/create-nsg-flow-log.png" alt-text="Screenshot of create Network Security Group flow log.":::

4. Enter or select the following information in **Create a flow log**.

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | **Project details** |   |
    | Subscription | Select your subscription. |
    | Network Security Group | Select **myVM-nsg**. |
    | Flow Log Name | Leave the default of **myVM-nsg-myResourceGroup-flowlog**.
    | **Instance details** |   |
    | Select storage account |   |
    | Subscription | Select your subscription. |
    | Storage Accounts | Select the storage account you created in the previous steps. |

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you learned how to:

* Enable NSG flow logging for an NSG
* Download and view data logged in a file. 

The raw data in the json file can be difficult to interpret. To visualize Flow Logs data, you can use [Azure Traffic Analytics](traffic-analytics.md) and  [Microsoft Power BI](network-watcher-visualize-nsg-flow-logs-power-bi.md).

For alternate methods of enabling NSG Flow Logs, see [PowerShell](network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-powershell.md), [Azure CLI](network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-cli.md), [REST API](network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-rest.md), and [Resource Manager templates](network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-azure-resource-manager.md).

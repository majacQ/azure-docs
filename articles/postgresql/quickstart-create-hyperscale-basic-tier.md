# Create a Hyperscale (Citus) basic tier server group in the Azure portal

Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Hyperscale (Citus) is a managed service that
you use to run, manage, and scale highly available PostgreSQL databases in the
cloud. Its [basic tier](concepts-hyperscale-tiers.md) is a a convenient
deployment option for initial development and testing.

This quickstart shows you how to create a Hyperscale (Citus) basic tier
server group using the Azure portal. You'll provision the server group
and verify that you can connect to it to run queries.

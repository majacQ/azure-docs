### Enable access policy enforcement for the Azure Storage account
The following PowerShell commands need to be executed in the subscription where the Azure Storage account resides. This will cover all Azure Storage accounts in that subscription.

```powershell
# Install the Az module
Install-Module -Name Az -Scope CurrentUser -Repository PSGallery -Force
# Login into the subscription
Connect-AzAccount -Subscription <SubscriptionID>
# Register the feature
Register-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName AllowPurviewPolicyEnforcement -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Storage
```
If the output of the last command shows value of “RegistrationState” as “Registered”, then your subscription is enabled for this functionality.

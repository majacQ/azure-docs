# Connect to and manage Snowflake in Azure Purview (Preview)

This article outlines how to register Snowflake, and how to authenticate and interact with Snowflake in Azure Purview. For more information about Azure Purview, read the [introductory article](overview.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Snowflake as a source is currently in PREVIEW. The [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

## Supported capabilities

|**Metadata Extraction**|  **Full Scan**  |**Incremental Scan**|**Scoped Scan**|**Classification**|**Access Policy**|**Lineage**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Yes](#register)| [Yes](#scan)| No | No | No | No| Yes|

When scanning Snowflake, Purview supports:

- Extract metadata including Snowflake server, databases, schemas, tables, views, stored procedures, functions, pipes, stages, streams, tasks, sequences, and table/view/stream columns.
- Fetch static lineage on assets relationships among tables, views, and streams.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

* An active [Purview resource](create-catalog-portal.md).

* You will need to be a Data Source Administrator and Data Reader to register a source and manage it in the Purview Studio. See our [Azure Purview Permissions page](catalog-permissions.md) for details.

* Set up the latest [self-hosted integration runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=39717). For more information, seeÂ [the create and configure a self-hosted integration runtime guide](../data-factory/create-self-hosted-integration-runtime.md). The minimal supported Self-hosted Integration Runtime version is 5.11.7971.2.

* Ensure [JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html) is installed on the virtual machine where the self-hosted integration runtime is installed.

* Ensure Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012 Update 4 is installed on the self-hosted integration runtime machine. If you don't have this update installed, [you can download it here](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=30679).

* The Snowflake user must have read access to system tables in order to access advanced metadata.

## Register

This section describes how to register Snowflake in Azure Purview using the [Purview Studio](https://web.purview.azure.com/).

### Steps to register

To register a new Snowflake source in your data catalog, do the following:

1. Navigate to your Purview account in the [Purview Studio](https://web.purview.azure.com/resource/).
1. Select **Data Map** on the left navigation.
1. Select **Register**
1. On Register sources, select **Snowflake**. Select **Continue**.

On the **Register sources (Snowflake)** screen, do the following:

1. Enter a **Name** that the data source will be listed within the Catalog.

1. Enter the **server** URL used to connect to the Snowflake account, for example, `xy12345.east-us-2.azure.snowflakecomputing.com`.

1. Select a collection or create a new one (Optional)

## Scan

Follow the steps below to scan Snowflake to automatically identify assets and classify your data. For more information about scanning in general, see our [introduction to scans and ingestion](concept-scans-and-ingestion.md).

### Authentication for a scan

The supported authentication type for a Snowflake source is **Basic authentication**.

### Create and run scan

To create and run a new scan, do the following:

1. In the Management Center, select Integration runtimes. Make sure a self-hosted integration runtime is set up. If it is not set up, use the steps mentioned [here](./manage-integration-runtimes.md) to create a self-hosted integration runtime.

1. Navigate to **Sources**.

1. Select the registered Snowflake source.

1. Select **+ New scan**.

1. Provide the below details:

    1. **Name**: The name of the scan

    1. **Connect via integration runtime**: Select the configured
        self-hosted integration runtime

    1. **Credential**: Select the credential to connect to your data source. Make sure to:
        * Select **Basic Authentication** while creating a credential.
        * Provide the user name used to connect to Snowflake in the User name input field.
        * Store the user password used to connect to Snowflake in the secret key.

    1. **Warehouse**: Specify the name of the warehouse instance to use.

    1. **Database**: Specify the name of the database instance to import.

    1. **Schema**: List subset of schemas to import expressed as a semicolon separated list. For example, `schema1; schema2`. All user schemas are imported if that list is empty. All system schemas and objects are ignored by default.
        
        Acceptable schema name patterns using SQL LIKE expressions syntax include using %. For example: `A%; %B; %C%; D`:
        * Start with A or
        * End with B or
        * Contain C or
        * Equal D

        Usage of NOT and special characters are not acceptable.

    1. **Maximum memory available**: Maximum memory (in GB) available on customer's VM to be used by scanning processes. It's dependent on the size of Snowflake source to be scanned.

        > [!Note]
        > As a rule of thumb, please provide 1GB memory for every 1000 tables.

        :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-snowflake/scan.png" alt-text="scan Snowflake" border="true":::

1. Select **Continue**.

1. Choose your **scan trigger**. You can set up a schedule or ran the scan once.

1. Review your scan and select **Save and Run**.

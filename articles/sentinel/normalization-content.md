# Advanced SIEM Information Model (ASIM) security content  (Public preview)

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](./includes/banner.md)]

Normalized security content in Microsoft Sentinel includes analytics rules, hunting queries, and workbooks that work with source-agnostic normalization parsers.

<a name="builtin"></a>You can find normalized, built-in content in Microsoft Sentinel galleries and [solutions](sentinel-solutions-catalog.md), create your own normalized content, or modify existing content to use normalized data.

This article lists built-in Microsoft Sentinel content that has been configured to support ASIM.  While links to the Microsoft Sentinel GitHub repository are provided below as a reference, you can also find these rules in the [Microsoft Sentinel Analytics rule gallery](detect-threats-built-in.md). Use the linked GitHub pages to copy any relevant hunting queries.

## Registry Activity security content

The following built-in registry activity content is supported for ASIM normalization.

### Hunting queries

- [Persisting Via IFEO Registry Key](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/Hunting%20Queries/MultipleDataSources/PersistViaIFEORegistryKey.yaml)

## <a name="modify"></a>Modify your content to use normalized data

To enable your custom content to use normalization:

- Modify your queries to use the source-agnostic parsers relevant to the query.
- Modify field names in your query to use the normalized schema field names.
- When applicable, change conditions to use the normalized values of the fields in your query.

For example, consider the **Rare client observed with high reverse DNS lookup count** DNS analytic rule, which works on DNS events send by Infoblox DNS servers:

```kusto
let threshold = 200;
InfobloxNIOS
| where ProcessName =~ "named" and Log_Type =~ "client"
| where isnotempty(ResponseCode)
| where ResponseCode =~ "NXDOMAIN"
| summarize count() by Client_IP, bin(TimeGenerated,15m)
| where count_ > threshold
| join kind=inner (InfobloxNIOS
    | where ProcessName =~ "named" and Log_Type =~ "client"
    | where isnotempty(ResponseCode)
    | where ResponseCode =~ "NXDOMAIN"
    ) on Client_IP
| extend timestamp = TimeGenerated, IPCustomEntity = Client_IP
```

The following code is the source-agnostic version, which uses normalization to provide the same detection for any source providing DNS query events:

```kusto
imDns(responsecodename='NXDOMAIN')
| summarize count() by SrcIpAddr, bin(TimeGenerated,15m)
| where count_ > threshold
| join kind=inner (imDns(responsecodename='NXDOMAIN')) on SrcIpAddr
| extend timestamp = TimeGenerated, IPCustomEntity = SrcIpAddr```
```

The normalized, source-agnostic version has the following differences:

- The `imDns`normalized parser is used instead of the Infoblox Parser.

- `imDns` fetches only DNS query events, so there is no need for checking the event type, as performed by the `where ProcessName =~ "named" and Log_Type =~ "client"` in the Infoblox version.

- The `SrcIpAddr` field is used instead of `Client_IP`.
 
- Parser parameter filtering is used for ResponseCodeName, eliminating the need for explicit where clauses.


Apart from supporting any normalized DNS source, the normalized version is shorter and easier to understand. 

If the schema or parsers do not support filtering parameters, the changes are similar, excluding the last one. Instead the filtering conditions are kept from the original query as seen below:

```kusto
let threshold = 200;
imDns
| where isnotempty(ResponseCodeName)
| where ResponseCodeName =~ "NXDOMAIN"
| summarize count() by SrcIpAddr, bin(TimeGenerated,15m)
| where count_ > threshold
| join kind=inner (imDns
    | where isnotempty(ResponseCodeName)
    | where ResponseCodeName =~ "NXDOMAIN"
    ) on SrcIpAddr
| extend timestamp = TimeGenerated, IPCustomEntity = SrcIpAddr
```

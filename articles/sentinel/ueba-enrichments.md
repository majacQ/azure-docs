# Microsoft Sentinel UEBA enrichments reference

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](./includes/banner.md)]

This article describes the Microsoft Sentinel **BehaviorAnalytics** table found in **Logs** and mentioned on the [entity details pages](identify-threats-with-entity-behavior-analytics.md#how-to-use-entity-pages), and provides the details of the entity enrichments fields in that table, the contents of which you can use to focus and sharpen your security incident investigations.

The following three dynamic fields from the BehaviorAnalytics table are described in the [tables below](#entity-enrichments-dynamic-fields).

The [UsersInsights](#usersinsights-field) and  [DevicesInsights](#devicesinsights-field) fields contain entity information from Active Directory / Azure AD and Microsoft Threat Intelligence sources.

The [ActivityInsights](#activityinsights-field) field contains entity information based on the behavioral profiles built by Microsoft Sentinel's entity behavior analytics. 

<a name="baseline-explained"></a>User activities are analyzed against a baseline that is dynamically compiled each time it is used. Each activity has its defined lookback period from which the dynamic baseline is derived. The lookback period is specified in the [**Baseline**](#activityinsights-field) column in this table.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Enrichment name** column in all the [entity enrichment field](#entity-enrichments-dynamic-fields) tables displays two rows of information. 
>
> - The first, in **bold**, is the "friendly name" of the enrichment.
> - The second *(in italics and parentheses)* is the field name of the enrichment as stored in the [**Behavior Analytics table**](#behavioranalytics-table).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Noted features are currently in PREVIEW. The [Azure Preview Supplemental Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

## IdentityInfo table (Public Preview)

After you [enable UEBA](enable-entity-behavior-analytics.md) for your Microsoft Sentinel workspace, data from your Azure Active Directory is synchronized to the **IdentityInfo** table in Log Analytics for use in Microsoft Sentinel. You can embed user data synchronized from your Azure AD from the  in your analytics rules to enhance your analytics to fit your use cases and reduce false positives.

While the initial synchronization may take a few days, once the data is fully synchronized:

- Changes made to your user profiles in Azure AD are updated in the **IdentityInfo** table within 15 minutes.

- Group and role information is synchronized between the **IdentityInfo** table and Azure AD daily.

- Every 21 days, Microsoft Sentinel re-synchronizes with your entire Azure AD to ensure that stale records are fully updated.

- Default retention time in the **IdentityInfo** table is 30 days.


> [!NOTE]
> Currently, only built-in roles are supported.
>
> Data about deleted groups, where a user was removed from a group, is not currently supported.

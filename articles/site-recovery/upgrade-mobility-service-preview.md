# Upgrade Mobility Service and Appliance components (Preview)

From this preview, you do not need to maintain source machine's Root/Admin credentials are not required for performing upgrades. The credentials are required only for the initial installation of the agent. Once done, you can remove the credentials.


## Update mobility agent automatically

By default, automatic updates are enabled on a vault. Automatic updates will be triggered at 12:00 AM local time every day, if a new version is available.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using private preview bits, automatic updates are blocked for the protected machines. Ensure that you setup Site Recovery on your machine again, using a fresh Preview appliance.

To avail the latest features, enhancements and fixes, we recommend you to choose **Allow Site Recovery to manage** option on the **Mobility agent upgrade settings (Preview)**. Automatic updates do not require a reboot or affect on-going replication of your virtual machines. Automatic updates also ensure that all the replication appliances in the vault are automatically updated.

# Monitor app lifecycle events using Azure Activity log and Azure Service Health

This article shows you how to monitor app lifecycle events and set up alerts with Azure Activity log and Azure Service Health.

Azure Spring Cloud provides built-in tools to monitor the status and health of your applications. App lifecycle events help you understand any changes that were made to your applications so you can take action as necessary. 

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
- A deployed Azure Spring Cloud service instance and at least one application already created in your service instance. For more information, see [Quickstart: Deploy your first Spring Boot app in Azure Spring Cloud](quickstart.md). 

## Monitor app lifecycle events triggered by users in Azure Activity logs

[Azure Activity logs](../azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log.md) contain resource events emitted by operations taken on the resources in your subscription. The following details for application lifecycle events (start, stop, restart) are added into Azure Activity Logs:

- When the operation occurred
- The status of the operation
- Which instance(s) are created when you start your app
- Which instance(s) are deleted when you stop your app
- Which instance(s) are deleted and created when you restart your app

For example, when you restart your app, you can find the affected instances from the **Activity log** detail page in the Azure portal.

## Monitor app lifecycle events in Azure Service Health

[Azure Resource Health](../service-health/resource-health-overview.md) helps you diagnose and get support for issues that may affect the availability of your service. These issues include service incidents, planned maintenance periods, and regional outages. Application restarting events are added into Azure Service Health. They include both unexpected incidents (for example, an unplanned app crash) and scheduled actions (for example, planned maintenance).

### Monitor unplanned app lifecycle events

When your app is restarted because of unplanned events, your Azure Spring Cloud instance will show a status of **degraded** in the **Resource health** section of the Azure portal. Degraded means that your resource detected a potential loss in performance, although it's still available for use. Examples of unplanned events include app crash, health check failure, and system outage.

You can find the latest status, the root cause, and affected instances in the health history page.

### Monitor planned app lifecycle events

Your app may be restarted during platform maintenance. You can receive a maintenance notification in advance from the **Planned maintenance** page of Azure Service Health.

When platform maintenance happens, your Azure Spring Cloud instance will also show a status of **degraded**. If restarting is needed during platform maintenance, Azure Spring Cloud will perform a rolling update to incrementally update your applications. Rolling updates are designed to update your workloads without downtime. You can find the latest status in the health history page.

>[!NOTE]
> Currently, Azure Spring Cloud performs one regular planned maintenance to upgrade the underlying Kubernetes version every 2-4 months. For a detailed maintenance timeline, check the notifications on the Azure Service Health page.

## Set up alerts

You can set up alerts for app lifecycle events. Service health notifications are also stored in the Azure activity log. The activity log stores a large volume of information, so there's a separate user interface to make it easier to view and set up alerts on service health notifications.

The following list describes the key steps needed to set up an alert: 

1. Set up an action group with the actions to take when an alert is triggered. Example action types include sending a voice call, SMS, email; or triggering various types of automated actions. Various alerts may use the same action group or different action groups depending on the user's requirements.
2. Set up alert rules. The alerts use action groups to notify users that an alert for some specific app lifecycle event has been triggered.

### Set up alerts on Activity log

The following steps show you how to create an activity log alert rule in the Azure portal:

1. Navigate to **Activity log**, open the detail page for any activity log, then select **New alert rule**.

2. Select the **Scope** for the alert.

3. Specify the alert **Condition**.

4. Select **Actions** and add **Alert rule details**.

5. Select **Create alert rule**.

### Set up alerts to monitor app lifecycle events in Azure Service Health

The following steps show you how to create an alert rule for service health notifications in the Azure portal:

1. Navigate to **Resource health** under **Service Health**, then select **Add resource health alert**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-app-lifecycle-events/add-resource-health-alert.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the resource health pane with the 'Add resource health alert' button highlighted":::

2. Select the **Resource** for the alert.

3. Specify the **Alert condition**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-app-lifecycle-events/resource-health-alert-condition.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a resource health alert condition":::

4. Select the **Actions** and add **Alert rule details**.

5. Select **Create alert rule**.

### Set up alerts to monitor the planned maintenance notification

The following steps show you how to create an alert rule for planned maintenance notifications in the Azure portal:

1. Navigate to **Health alerts** under **Service Health**, then select **Add service health alert**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-app-lifecycle-events/add-service-health-alert.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the health alerts pane with the 'Add service health alert' button highlighted":::

2. Provide values for **Subscription**, **Service(s)**, **Region(s)**, **Event type**, **Actions**, and **Alert rule details**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-app-lifecycle-events/add-service-health-alert-details.png" lightbox="media/monitor-app-lifecycle-events/add-service-health-alert-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the 'Create rule alert' pane for Service Health":::

3. Select **Create alert rule**.

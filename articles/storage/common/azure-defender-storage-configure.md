# Configure Microsoft Defender for Storage

Microsoft Defender for Storage provides an additional layer of security intelligence that detects unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit storage accounts. This layer of protection allows you to address threats without being a security expert or managing security monitoring systems.

Security alerts are triggered when anomalies in activity occur. These security alerts are integrated with [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/security-center/), and are also sent via email to subscription administrators, with details of suspicious activity and recommendations on how to investigate and remediate threats.

The service ingests resource logs of read, write, and delete requests to Blob storage and to Azure Files for threat detection. To investigate alerts from Microsoft Defender for Cloud, you can view related storage activity using Storage Analytics Logging. For more information, see **Configure logging** in [Monitor a storage account in the Azure portal](./manage-storage-analytics-logs.md#configure-logging).

## Availability

Microsoft Defender for Storage is currently available for Blob storage, Azure Files, and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. Account types that support Microsoft Defender for Storage include general-purpose v2, block blob, and Blob storage accounts. Microsoft Defender for Storage is available in all public clouds and US government clouds, but not in other sovereign or Azure Government cloud regions.

Accounts with hierarchical namespaces enabled for Data Lake Storage support transactions using both the Azure Blob storage APIs and the Data Lake Storage APIs. Azure file shares support transactions over SMB.

Remember to replace values in angle brackets with your own values:

```azurepowershell
Enable-AzSecurityAdvancedThreatProtection -ResourceId "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<storage-account>/"
```

To check the Microsoft Defender for Storage setting for a storage account via PowerShell, call the [Get-AzSecurityAdvancedThreatProtection](/powershell/module/az.security/get-azsecurityadvancedthreatprotection) command. Remember to replace values in angle brackets with your own values:

```azurepowershell
Get-AzSecurityAdvancedThreatProtection -ResourceId "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<storage-account>/"
```

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To enable Microsoft Defender for Storage for a storage account via Azure CLI, call the [az security atp storage update](/cli/azure/security/atp/storage#az_security_atp_storage_update) command. Remember to replace values in angle brackets with your own values:

```azurecli
az security atp storage update \
    --resource-group <resource-group> \
    --storage-account <storage-account> \
    --is-enabled true
```

To check the Microsoft Defender for Storage setting for a storage account via Azure CLI, call the [az security atp storage show](/cli/azure/security/atp/storage#az_security_atp_storage_show) command. Remember to replace values in angle brackets with your own values:

## Explore security anomalies

When storage activity anomalies occur, you receive an email notification with information about the suspicious security event. Details of the event include:

- The nature of the anomaly
- The storage account name
- The event time
- The storage type
- The potential causes
- The investigation steps
- The remediation steps

The email also includes details on possible causes and recommended actions to investigate and mitigate the potential threat.

:::image type="content" source="media/azure-defender-storage-configure/storage-advanced-threat-protection-alert-email.png" alt-text="Microsoft Defender for Storage alert email":::

You can review and manage your current security alerts from Microsoft Defender for Cloud's [Security alerts tile](../../security-center/security-center-managing-and-responding-alerts.md). Select an alert for details and actions for investigating the current threat and addressing future threats.

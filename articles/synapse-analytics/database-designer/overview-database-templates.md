# What is Azure Synapse database templates

Data takes many forms as it moves from source systems to data warehouses and data marts with the intent to solve business problems. Database templates can help with the transformation of data into insights. Database templates are a set of business and technical data definitions that are pre-designed to meet the needs of a particular industry. They act as blueprints that provide common elements derived from best practices, government regulations, and the complex data and analytic needs of an industry-specific organization. 

These information blueprints can be used by organizations to plan, architect, and design data solutions for data governance, reporting, business intelligence, and advanced analytics. The data models provide integrated business-wide information architectures that can help you implement, in a timely and predictable way, a proven industry data architecture. 

For example, if you're building a product recommendation solution for your retail customers, you'll need a basic blue-print to understand what the customer purchased and the transaction that led to the purchase. You may also need information about the store where the purchase was made. You also need to understand whether the customer is part of a loyalty program. Just to accomplish this use case we need the following schemas: 

 - Product 
 - Transaction 
 - TransactionLineItem 
 - Customer 
 - CustomerLoyalty 
 - Store 

You can set up this use case by selecting the six tables in the retail database template.

A typical database template addresses the core requirements of a specific industry and consists of: 

 - A supporting set of [business area templates](concepts-database-templates.md#business-area-templates).
 - One or more [enterprise templates](concepts-database-templates.md#enterprise-templates).  

## Available database templates 

Currently there are six database templates available within Azure Synapse Studio that customers can use to start creating their lake database. 

 - **Banking** - for companies who are analyzing banking data.
 - **Consumer Goods** - for manufacturers or producers of goods bought and used by consumers.
 - **Fund Management** - for companies managing investment funds for investors.
 - **Life Insurance & Annuities** -Â for companies who provide life insurance, sell annuities, or both.
 - **Property & Casualty Insurance** - for companies who provide insurance against risks to property and various forms of liability coverage.
 - **Retail** - for sellers of consumer goods or services to customers through multiple channels.

As emission and carbon management is an important discussion in all industries, we've included those components in all the available database templates. These components make it easy for companies who need to track and report their direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions.

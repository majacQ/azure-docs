# Enable scaling plans for existing and new host pools (preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The autoscale feature is currently in preview.
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

You can enable scaling plans for any existing host pools in your deployment. When you apply your scaling plan to the host pool, the plan will also apply to all session hosts within that host pool. Scaling also automatically applies to any new session hosts you create in your assigned host pool.

If you disable a scaling plan, all assigned resources will remain in the scaling state they were in at the time you disabled it.

## Assign a scaling plan to an existing host pool

To assign a scaling plan to an existing host pool:

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. Go to **Windows Virtual Desktop**.

3. Select **Host pools**, then go to **Scaling plan** and select **New**.

4. Select **Scaling plan**, then select **+ Assign** to assign a scaling plan to an unassigned host pool, as shown in the following screenshot.

    If you've enabled the scaling plan during deployment, then you'll also have the option to disable the plan for the selected host pool in the **Scaling plan** menu by unselecting the **Enable scaling plan** checkbox, as shown in the following screenshot.

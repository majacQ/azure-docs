# Associate a virtual machine scale set to a Capacity Reservation Group (preview)

Virtual Machine Scale Sets have two modes: 

- **Uniform Orchestration Mode:** In this mode, virtual machine scale sets use a VM profile or a template to scale up to the desired capacity. While there's some ability to manage or customize individual VM instances, Uniform uses identical VM instances. These instances are exposed through the virtual machine scale sets VM APIs and aren't compatible with the standard Azure IaaS VM API commands. Since the scale set performs all the actual VM operations, reservations are associated with the virtual machine scale set directly. Once the scale set is associated with the reservation, all the subsequent VM allocations will be done against the reservation. 
- **Flexible Orchestration Mode:** In this mode, you get more flexibility managing the individual virtual machine scale set VM instances as they can use the standard Azure IaaS VM APIs instead of using the scale set interface. This mode won't work with Capacity Reservation during public preview.

To learn more about these modes, go to [Virtual Machine Scale Sets Orchestration Modes](../virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-orchestration-modes.md). The rest of this article will cover how to associate a Uniform virtual machine scale set to a Capacity Reservation Group. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Capacity Reservation is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service-level agreement, and we don't recommend it for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).


## Limitations of scale sets in Uniform Orchestration 

- For Virtual Machine Scale Sets in Uniform orchestration to be compatible with Capacity Reservation, the `singlePlacementGroup` property must be set to *False*. 
- The **Static Fixed Spreading** availability option for multi-zone Uniform scale sets is not supported with Capacity Reservation. This option requires use of 5 Fault Domains while the reservations only support up to 3 Fault Domains for general purpose sizes. The recommended approach is to use the **Max Spreading** option that spreads VMs across as many FDs as possible within each zone. If needed, configure a custom Fault Domain configuration of 3 or less. 

There are some other restrictions while using Capacity Reservation. For the complete list, refer the [Capacity Reservations overview](capacity-reservation-overview.md).  

## Associate a new virtual machine scale set to a Capacity Reservation Group


### [API](#tab/api1)  

To associate a new Uniform virtual machine scale set to a Capacity Reservation Group, construct the following PUT request to the *Microsoft.Compute* provider:

```rest
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/{VMScaleSetName}?api-version=2021-04-01
```

Add the `capacityReservationGroup` property in the `virtualMachineProfile` as shown below: 

```json
{ 
    "name": "<VMScaleSetName>", 
    "id": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/{VMScaleSetName}", 
    "type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets", 
    "location": "eastus", 
    "sku": { 
        "name": "Standard_D2s_v3", 
        "tier": "Standard", 
        "capacity": 3 
}, 
"properties": { 
    "virtualMachineProfile": { 
        "capacityReservation": { 
            "capacityReservationGroup":{ 
                "id":"subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/CapacityReservationGroup/{CapacityReservationGroupName}" 
            } 
         }, 
        "osProfile": { 
            … 
        }, 
        "storageProfile": { 
            … 
        }, 
        "networkProfile": { 
            …,
            "extensionProfile": { 
                … 
            } 
        } 
    } 
```

### [CLI](#tab/cli1)

Use `az vmss create` to create a new virtual machine scale set and add the `capacity-reservation-group` property to associate the scale set to an existing capacity reservation group. The example below creates a Uniform scale set for a Standard_Ds1_v2 VM in the East US location and associates the scale set to a capacity reservation group.

```azurecli-interactive
az vmss create 
--resource-group myResourceGroup 
--name myVMSS 
--location eastus 
--vm-sku Standard_Ds1_v2 
--image UbuntuLTS 
--capacity-reservation-group /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/capacityReservationGroups/{capacityReservationGroupName} 
```


### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell1) 

Use `New-AzVmss` to create a new virtual machine scale set and add the `CapacityReservationGroupId` property to associate the scale set to an existing capacity reservation group. The example below creates a Uniform scale set for a Standard_Ds1_v2 VM in the East US location and associates the scale set to a capacity reservation group.

```powershell-interactive
$vmssName = <"VMSSNAME">
$vmPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString <"PASSWORD"> -AsPlainText -Force
$vmCred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential(<"USERNAME">, $vmPassword)
New-AzVmss
–Credential $vmCred
-VMScaleSetName $vmssName
-ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup"
-CapacityReservationGroupId "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/capacityReservationGroups/{capacityReservationGroupName}"
-PlatformFaultDomainCount 2
```

To learn more, go to Azure PowerShell command [New-AzVmss](/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azvmss).

### [ARM template](#tab/arm1)

An [ARM template](../azure-resource-manager/templates/overview.md) is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your project. The template uses declarative syntax. In declarative syntax, you describe your intended deployment without writing the sequence of programming commands to create the deployment. 

ARM templates let you deploy groups of related resources. In a single template, you can create capacity reservation group and capacity reservations. You can deploy templates through the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell, or from continuous integration / continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. 

If your environment meets the prerequisites and you're familiar with using ARM templates, use this [Create Virtual Machine Scale Sets with Capacity Reservation](https://github.com/Azure/on-demand-capacity-reservation/blob/main/VirtualMachineScaleSetWithReservation.json) template.

## Associate an existing virtual machine scale set to Capacity Reservation Group 

For Public Preview, in order to associate an existing Uniform virtual machine scale set to the capacity reservation group, it is required to first deallocate the scale set and then do the association at the time of reallocation. This ensures that all the scale set VMs consume capacity reservation at the time of reallocation.

### Important notes on Upgrade Policies 

- **Automatic Upgrade** – In this mode, the scale set VM instances are automatically associated with the Capacity Reservation Group without any further action from you. When the scale set VMs are reallocated, they start consuming the reserved capacity.
- **Rolling Upgrade** – In this mode, scale set VM instances are associated with the Capacity Reservation Group without any further action from you. However, they're updated in batches with an optional pause time between them. When the scale set VMs are reallocated, they start consuming the reserved capacity.
- **Manual Upgrade** – In this mode, nothing happens to the scale set VM instances when the virtual machine scale set is attached to a capacity reservation group. You'll need to do individual updates to each scale set VM by [upgrading it with the latest Scale Set model](../virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-upgrade-scale-set.md#how-to-bring-vms-up-to-date-with-the-latest-scale-set-model).

### [API](#tab/api2)

1. Deallocate the virtual machine scale set. 

    ```rest
    POST https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourcegroupname}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/{VMScaleSetName}/deallocate?api-version=2021-04-01
    ```

1. Add the `capacityReservationGroup` property to the scale set model. Construct the following PUT request to *Microsoft.Compute* provider:

    ```rest
    PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourcegroupname}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/{VMScaleSetName}?api-version=2021-04-01
    ```

    In the request body, include the `capacityReservationGroup` property:

    ```json
    "location": "eastus",
    "properties": {
        "virtualMachineProfile": {
             "capacityReservation": {
                      "capacityReservationGroup": {
                            "id": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/capacityReservationGroups/{capacityReservationGroupName}"
                      }
                }
        }
    }
    ```

### [CLI](#tab/cli2)

1. Deallocate the virtual machine scale set. 

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az vmss deallocate 
    --location eastus
    --resource-group myResourceGroup 
    --name myVMSS 
    ```

1. Associate the scale set to the capacity reservation group. 

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az vmss update 
    --resource-group myResourceGroup 
    --name myVMSS 
    --capacity-reservation-group /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/capacityReservationGroups/{capacityReservationGroupName}
    ```

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell2) 

1. Deallocate the virtual machine scale set. 

    ```powershell-interactive
    Stop-AzVmss
    -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup”
    -VMScaleSetName "myVmss”
    ```

1. Associate the scale set to the capacity reservation group. 

    ```powershell-interactive
    $vmss =
    Get-AzVmss
    -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup"
    -VMScaleSetName "myVmss"
    
    Update-AzVmss
    -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup"
    -VMScaleSetName "myVmss"
    -VirtualMachineScaleSet $vmss
    -CapacityReservationGroupId "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/capacityReservationGroups/{capacityReservationGroupName}"
    ```

To learn more, go to Azure PowerShell commands [Stop-AzVmss](/powershell/module/az.compute/stop-azvmss), [Get-AzVmss](/powershell/module/az.compute/get-azvmss), and [Update-AzVmss](/powershell/module/az.compute/update-azvmss).

## View virtual machine scale set association with Instance View 

Once the Uniform virtual machine scale set is associated with the Capacity Reservation Group, all the subsequent VM allocations will happen against the Capacity Reservation. Azure automatically finds the matching Capacity Reservation in the group and consumes a reserved slot. 

### [API](#tab/api3) 

The Capacity Reservation Group *Instance View* will reflect the new scale set VMs under the `virtualMachinesAssociated` & `virtualMachinesAllocated` properties as shown below: 

```rest
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/CapacityReservationGroups/{CapacityReservationGroupName}?$expand=instanceview&api-version=2021-04-01 
```

```json
{ 
    "name": "<CapacityReservationGroupName>", 
    "id": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/capacityReservationGroups/{CapacityReservationGroupName}", 
    "type": "Microsoft.Compute/capacityReservationGroups", 
    "location": "eastus" 
}, 
    "properties": { 
        "capacityReservations": [ 
            { 
                "id": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/capacityReservationGroups/{CapacityReservationGroupName}/capacityReservations/{CapacityReservationName}" 
            } 
        ], 
        "virtualMachinesAssociated": [ 
            { 
                "id": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/{VMScaleSetName}/virtualMachines/{VirtualMachineId}" 
            } 
        ], 
        "instanceView": { 
            "capacityReservations": [ 
                { 
                    "name": "<CapacityReservationName>", 
                    "utilizationInfo": { 
                        "virtualMachinesAllocated": [ 
                            { 
                                "id": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/{VMScaleSetName}/virtualMachines/{VirtualMachineId}" 
                            } 
                        ] 
                    },
                    "statuses": [ 
                        { 
                            "code": "ProvisioningState/succeeded", 
                            "level": "Info", 
                            "displayStatus": "Provisioning succeeded", 
                            "time": "2021-05-25T15:12:10.4165243+00:00" 
                        } 
                    ] 
                }

## Region and Availability Zones considerations 

Virtual machine scale sets can be created regionally or in one or more Availability Zones to protect them from data-center-level failure. Learn more about multi-zonal virtual machine scale sets, refer to [Virtual Machine Scale Sets that use Availability Zones](../virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-use-availability-zones.md).  

 
>[!IMPORTANT]
> The location (Region and Availability Zones) of the virtual machine scale set and the Capacity Reservation Group must match for the association to succeed. For a regional scale set, the region must match between the scale set and the Capacity Reservation Group. For a zonal scale set, both the regions and the zones must match between the scale set and the Capacity Reservation Group. 


When a scale set is spread across multiple zones, it always attempts to deploy evenly across the included Availability Zones. Because of that even deployment, a Capacity Reservation Group should always have the same quantity of reserved VMs in each zone. As an illustration of why this is important, consider the example below.   

In this example, each zone has a different quantity reserved. Let’s say that the virtual machine scale set scales out to 75 instances. Since scale set will always attempt to deploy evenly across zones, the VM distribution should look like this: 

| Zone  | Quantity Reserved  | No. of scale set VMs in each zone  | Unused Quantity Reserved  | Overallocated   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1  | 40  | 25  | 15  | 0  |
| 2  | 20  | 25  | 0  | 5  |
| 3  | 15  | 25  | 0  | 10  |

In this case, the scale set is incurring extra cost for 15 unused instances in Zone 1. The scale-out is also relying on 5 VMs in Zone 2 and 10 VMs in Zone 3 that aren't protected by Capacity Reservation. If each zone had 25 capacity instances reserved, then all 75 VMs would be protected by Capacity Reservation and the deployment wouldn't incur any extra cost for unused instances.  

Since the reservations can be overallocated, the scale set can continue to scale normally beyond the limits of the reservation. The only difference is that the VMs allocated above the quantity reserved aren't covered by Capacity Reservation SLA. To learn more, go to [Overallocating Capacity Reservation](capacity-reservation-overallocate.md).

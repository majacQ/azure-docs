# Flexible orchestration for virtual machine scale sets in Azure

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets

Virtual machine scale sets with Flexible orchestration allows you to combine the scalability of [virtual machine scale sets in Uniform orchestration mode](../virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview.md) with the regional availability guarantees of [availability sets](availability-set-overview.md).

Azure virtual machine scale sets let you create and manage a group of load balanced VMs. The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand or a defined schedule. Scale sets provide the following key benefits:
- Easy to create and manage multiple VMs
- Provides high availability and application resiliency by distributing VMs across availability zones or fault domains
- Allows your application to automatically scale as resource demand changes
- Works at large-scale

With Flexible orchestration, Azure provides a unified experience across the Azure VM ecosystem. Flexible orchestration offers high availability guarantees (up to 1000 VMs) by spreading VMs across fault domains in a region or within an Availability Zone. This enables you to scale out your application while maintaining fault domain isolation that is essential to run quorum-based or stateful workloads, including:
- Quorum-based workloads
- Open-source databases
- Stateful applications
- Services that require high availability and large scale
- Services that want to mix virtual machine types or leverage Spot and on-demand VMs together
- Existing Availability Set applications

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article is about virtual machine scale sets in Flexible orchestration mode, which we recommend using for all new scale set deployments. To access information about Uniform scale sets, go to [virtual machine scale sets in Uniform orchestration mode](../virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview.md) documentation.

Learn more about the differences between Uniform scale sets and Flexible scale sets in [Orchestration Modes](../virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-orchestration-modes.md).

> [!CAUTION]
> The orchestration mode is defined when you create the scale set and cannot be changed or updated later.


## Why use virtual machine scale sets?
To provide redundancy and improved performance, applications are typically distributed across multiple instances. Customers may access your application through a load balancer that distributes requests to one of the application instances. If you need to perform maintenance or update an application instance, your customers must be distributed to another available application instance. To keep up with extra customer demand, you may need to increase the number of application instances that run your application.

Azure virtual machine scale sets provide the management capabilities for applications that run across many VMs, automatic scaling of resources, and load balancing of traffic. Scale sets provide the following key benefits:

- **Easy to create and manage multiple VMs**
    - When you have many VMs that run your application, it's important to maintain a consistent configuration across your environment. For reliable performance of your application, the VM size, disk configuration, and application installs should match across all VMs.
    - With scale sets, all VM instances are created from the same base OS image and configuration. This approach lets you easily manage hundreds of VMs without extra configuration tasks or network management.
    - Scale sets support the use of the [Azure load balancer](../load-balancer/load-balancer-overview.md) for basic layer-4 traffic distribution, and [Azure Application Gateway](../application-gateway/overview.md) for more advanced layer-7 traffic distribution and TLS termination.

- **Provides high availability and application resiliency**
    - Scale sets are used to run multiple instances of your application. If one of these VM instances has a problem, customers continue to access your application through one of the other VM instances with minimal interruption.
    - For more availability, you can use [Availability Zones](../availability-zones/az-overview.md) to automatically distribute VM instances in a scale set within a single datacenter or across multiple datacenters.

- **Allows your application to automatically scale as resource demand changes**
    - Customer demand for your application may change throughout the day or week. To match customer demand, scale sets can automatically increase the number of VM instances as application demand increases, then reduce the number of VM instances as demand decreases.
    - Autoscale also minimizes the number of unnecessary VM instances that run your application when demand is low, while customers continue to receive an acceptable level of performance as demand grows and additional VM instances are automatically added. This ability helps reduce costs and efficiently create Azure resources as required.

- **Works at large-scale**
    - Scale sets support up to 1,000 VM instances for standard marketplace images and custom images through the Azure Compute Gallery (formerly known as Shared Image Gallery). If you create a scale set using a managed image, the limit is 600 VM instances.
    - For the best performance with production workloads, use [Azure Managed Disks](../virtual-machines/managed-disks-overview.md).



## Get started with Flexible orchestration mode

Get started with Flexible orchestration mode for your scale sets through the [Azure portal](flexible-virtual-machine-scale-sets-portal.md), [Azure CLI](flexible-virtual-machine-scale-sets-cli.md), [Azure PowerShell](flexible-virtual-machine-scale-sets-powershell.md), or [ARM Template](flexible-virtual-machine-scale-sets-rest-api.md). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Confirm that you have explicit outbound network connectivity. Learn more about this in [virtual networks and virtual machines in Azure](../virtual-network/network-overview.md) and make sure you are following Azure's networking [best practices](../virtual-network/concepts-and-best-practices.md).


## Add instances with autoscaling or manually
Virtual machine scale sets with Flexible orchestration works as a thin orchestration layer to manage multiple VMs. There are several ways you can add VMs to be managed by the scale set:

- **Set instance count**

    When you create the scale set with Flexible orchestration, define a VM profile or template which describes the template to be used to scale out. You can then set the capacity parameter to increase or decrease the number of VM instances managed by the scale set. 

- **Autoscaling with Metrics or Schedule** 

    Alternatively, you can set up autoscale rules to increase or decrease the capacity based on metrics or a schedule. See [Virtual machine scale sets with Autoscaling](..\virtual-machine-scale-sets\virtual-machine-scale-sets-autoscale-overview.md). 

- **Specify a scale set when creating a VM**

    When you create a VM, you can optionally specify that it is added to a virtual machine scale set. A VM can only be added to a scale set at time of VM creation. The newly created VM must be in the same resource group as the Flexible scale set regardless of deployment methods.

Flexible orchestration mode can be used with VM SKUs that support [memory preserving updates or live migration](../virtual-machines/maintenance-and-updates.md#maintenance-that-doesnt-require-a-reboot), which includes 90% of all IaaS VMs that are deployed in Azure. Broadly this includes general purpose size families such as B-, D-, E- and F-series VMs. Currently, the Flexible mode cannot orchestrate over VM SKUs or families which do not support memory preserving updates, including G-, H-, L-, M-, N- series VMs. You can use the [Compute Resource SKUs API](/rest/api/compute/resource-skus/list) to determine whether a specific VM SKU is supported.

```azurecli-interactive
az vm list-skus -l eastus --size standard_d2s_v3 --query "[].capabilities[].[name, value]" -o table
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Networking behavior will vary depending on how you choose to create virtual machines within your scale set. For more information, see [scalable network connectivity](../virtual-machines/flexible-virtual-machine-scale-sets-migration-resources.md#create-scalable-network-connectivity).

## Troubleshoot scale sets with Flexible orchestration
Find the right solution to your troubleshooting scenario.

<!-- error -->
### InvalidParameter. The specified fault domain count 3 must fall in the range 1 to 2.

```
InvalidParameter. The specified fault domain count 3 must fall in the range 1 to 2.
```

**Cause:** The `platformFaultDomainCount` parameter is invalid for the region or zone selected.

**Solution:** You must select a valid `platformFaultDomainCount` value. For zonal deployments, the maximum `platformFaultDomainCount` value is 1. For regional deployments where no zone is specified, the maximum `platformFaultDomainCount` varies depending on the region. See [Manage the availability of VMs for scripts](../virtual-machines/availability.md) to determine the maximum fault domain count per region.


<!-- error -->
### OperationNotAllowed. Deletion of Virtual Machine Scale Set is not allowed as it contains one or more VMs. Please delete or detach the VM(s) before deleting the Virtual Machine Scale Set.

```
OperationNotAllowed. Deletion of Virtual Machine Scale Set is not allowed as it contains one or more VMs. Please delete or detach the VM(s) before deleting the Virtual Machine Scale Set.
```

**Cause:** Trying to delete a scale set in Flexible orchestration mode that is associated with one or more virtual machines.

**Solution:** Delete all of the virtual machines associated with the scale set in Flexible orchestration mode, then you can delete the scale set.


<!-- error -->
### InvalidParameter. The value 'True' of parameter 'singlePlacementGroup' is not allowed. Allowed values are: False.

```
InvalidParameter. The value 'True' of parameter 'singlePlacementGroup' is not allowed. Allowed values are: False.
```
**Cause:** The `singlePlacementGroup` parameter is set to *True*.

**Solution:** The `singlePlacementGroup` must be set to *False*.


<!-- error -->
### OutboundConnectivityNotEnabledOnVM. No outbound connectivity configured for virtual machine.

```
OutboundConnectivityNotEnabledOnVM. No outbound connectivity configured for virtual machine.
```
**Cause:** Trying to create a Virtual Machine Scale Set in Flexible Orchestration Mode with no outbound internet connectivity.

**Solution:** Enable secure outbound access for your virtual machine scale set in the manner best suited for your application. Outbound access can be enabled with a NAT Gateway on your subnet, adding instances to a Load Balancer backend pool, or adding an explicit public IP per instance. For highly secure applications, you can specify custom User Defined Routes through your firewall or virtual network applications. See [Default Outbound Access](../virtual-network/ip-services/default-outbound-access.md) for more details.

# States and billing status of Azure Virtual Machines

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) go through different states that can be categorized into *provisioning* and *power* states. The purpose of this article is to describe these states and specifically highlight when customers are billed for instance usage. 

## Get states using Instance View

The instance view API provides VM running-state information. For more information, see the [Virtual Machines - Instance View](/rest/api/compute/virtualmachines/instanceview) API documentation.

Azure Resources Explorer provides a simple UI for viewing the VM running state: [Resource Explorer](https://resources.azure.com/).

The VM provisioning state is available (in slightly different forms) from within the VM properties `provisioningState` and the InstanceView. In the VM InstanceView there will be an element within the `status` array in the form of `ProvisioningState/<state>[/<errorCode>]`.

To retrieve the power state of all the VMs in your subscription, use the [Virtual Machines - List All API](/rest/api/compute/virtualmachines/listall) with parameter **statusOnly** set to *true*.

> [!NOTE]
> [Virtual Machines - List All API](/rest/api/compute/virtualmachines/listall) with parameter **statusOnly** set to true will retrieve the power states of all VMs in a subscription. However, in some rare situations, the power state may not available due to intermittent issues in the retrieval process. In such situations, we recommend retrying using the same API or using [Azure Resource Health](../service-health/resource-health-overview.md) to check the power state of your VMs.
 
## Power states and billing

The power state represents the last known state of the VM.

The following table provides a  description of each instance state and indicates whether it is billed for instance usage or not.

| Power state | Description | Billing |  
|---|---|---|
| Starting| Virtual Machine is powering up. | Billed | 
| Running | Virtual Machine is fully up. This is the standard working state. | Billed | 
| Stopping | This is a transitional state between running and stopped. | Billed| 
|Stopped | The Virtual Machine is allocated on a host but not running. Also called PoweredOff state or *Stopped (Allocated)*. This can be result of invoking the PowerOff API operation or invoking shutdown from within the guest OS. The Stopped state may also be observed briefly during VM creation or while starting a VM from Deallocated state.  | Billed | 
| Deallocating | This is the transitional state between running and deallocated. | Not billed* | 
| Deallocated | The Virtual Machine has released the lease on the underlying hardware and is completely powered off. This state is also referred to as *Stopped (Deallocated)*. | Not billed* | 


**Example of PowerState in JSON**

```json
        {
          "code": "PowerState/running",
          "level": "Info",
          "displayStatus": "VM running"
        }
```

&#42; Some Azure resources, such as [Disks](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-disks) and [Networking](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/bandwidth/) will continue to incur charges.


## Provisioning states

The provisioning state is the status of a user-initiated, control-plane operation on the VM. These states are separate from the power state of a VM.

| Provisioning state | Description |
|---|---|
| Creating | Virtual machine is being created. |
| Updating | Virtual machine is updating to the latest model. Some non-model changes to a virtual machine such as start and restart fall under the updating state. |
| Failed | Last operation on the virtual machine resource was not successful. | 
| Succeeded | Last operation on the virtual machine resource was successful. | 
| Deleting | Virtual machine is being deleted. | 
| Migrating | Seen when migrating from Azure Service Manager to Azure Resource Manager. | 

## OS Provisioning states
OS Provisioning states only apply to virtual machines created with a [generalized](./linux/imaging.md#generalized-images) OS image. [Specialized](./linux/imaging.md#specialized-images) images and disks attached as OS disk will not display these states. The OS provisioning state is not shown separately. It is a sub-state of the Provisioning State in the VM instanceView. For example, `ProvisioningState/creating/osProvisioningComplete`.

:::image type="content" source="./media/virtual-machines-common-states-lifecycle/os-provisioning-states.png" alt-text="Image shows the OS provisioning states a VM can go through.":::

| OS Provisioning state | Description | 
|---|---|
| OSProvisioningInProgress | The VM is running and the initialization (setup) of the Guest OS is in progress. |
| OSProvisioningComplete | This is a short-lived state. The virtual machine quickly transitions from this state to **Success**. If extensions are still being installed you will continue to see this state until they are complete. |
| Succeeded | The user-initiated actions have completed. | 
| Failed | Represents a failed operation. Refer to the error code for more information and possible solutions. |

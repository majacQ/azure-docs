# Monitoring Virtual WAN

You can monitor Azure Virtual WAN using Azure Monitor. Virtual WAN is a networking service that brings together many networking, security, and routing functionalities to provide a single operational interface. Virtual WAN VPN gateways, ExpressRoute gateways, and Azure Firewall have logging and metrics available through Azure Monitor. 

This article discusses metrics and diagnostics that are available through the portal. Metrics are lightweight and can support near real-time scenarios, making them useful for alerting and fast issue detection.

### Monitoring Secured Hub (Azure Firewall) 

If you have chosen to secure your Virtual Hub using Azure Firewall, relevant logs and metrics are available here: [Azure Firewall logs and metrics](../firewall/logs-and-metrics.md).
You can monitor the Secured Hub using Azure Firewall logs and metrics. You can also use activity logs to audit operations on Azure Firewall resources.
For every Azure Virtual WAN you secure and convert to a Secured Hub, an explicit firewall resource object is created in the resource group where the hub is located.

Diagnostics and logging configuration must be done from there accessing the **Diagnostic Setting** tab:

## Metrics

Metrics in Azure Monitor are numerical values that describe some aspect of a system at a particular time. Metrics are collected every minute, and are useful for alerting because they can be sampled frequently. An alert can be fired quickly with relatively simple logic.

### Site-to-site VPN gateways

The following metrics are available for Azure site-to-site VPN gateways:

#### Tunnel Packet Drop Metrics

| **Tunnel Egress TS Mismatch Packet Drop** | Outgoing packet drop count from traffic selector mismatch of a tunnel.|
| **Tunnel Ingress TS Mismatch Packet Drop** | Incoming packet drop count from traffic selector mismatch of a tunnel.|

#### IPSEC Metrics
| Metric | Description|

| **Count of routes learned from peer**| Count of Routes Learned from Peer by ExpressRoute Gateway.|
| **Frequency of routes changed** | Frequency of Route changes in ExpressRoute Gateway.|
| **Number of VMs in Virtual Network**| Number of VM's that use this ExpressRoute Gateway.|

### <a name="metrics-steps"></a>View gateway metrics

The following steps help you locate and view metrics:

1. In the portal, navigate to the virtual hub that has the gateway.

2. Select **VPN (Site to site)** to locate a site-to-site gateway, **ExpressRoute** to locate an ExpressRoute gateway, or **User VPN (Point to site)** to locate a point-to-site gateway.

3. Select **Metrics**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-virtual-wan/view-metrics.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows a site to site VPN pane with View in Azure Monitor selected.":::

4. On the **Metrics** page, you can view the metrics that you are interested in.

### <a name="diagnostic-steps"></a>View diagnostic logs configuration

The following steps help you create, edit, and view diagnostic settings:

1. In the portal, navigate to your Virtual WAN resource, then select **Hubs** in the **Connectivity** group. 

   :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-virtual-wan/select-hub.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Hub selection in the vWAN Portal.":::

2. Under the **Connectivity** group on the left select the gateway you want to examine the diagnostics:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-virtual-wan/select-hub-gateway.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Connectivity section for the hub.":::

3. On the right part of the page, click on **View in Azure Monitor** link right to **Logs**  then select an option. You can choose to send to Log Analytics, stream to an event hub, or to simply archive to a storage account.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-virtual-wan/view-hub-gateway-logs.png" alt-text="Screenshot for Select View in Azure Monitor for Logs.":::

4. In this page, you can create new diagnostic setting (**+Add diagnostic setting**) or edit existing one (**Edit setting**). You can choose to send the diagnostic logs to Log Analytics (as shown in the example below), stream to an event hub, send to a 3rd-party solution, or to archive to a storage account.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-virtual-wan/select-gateway-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot for Select Diagnostic Log settings.":::

### <a name="sample-query"></a>Log Analytics sample query

If you selected to send diagnostic data to a Log Analytics Workspace, then you can use SQL-like queries such as the example below to examine the data. For more information, see [Log Analytics Query Language](/services-hub/health/log_analytics_query_language).

The following example contains a query to obtain site-to-site route diagnostics.

`AzureDiagnostics | where Category == "RouteDiagnosticLog"`

Replace the values below, after the **= =**, as needed based on the tables reported in the previous section of this article.

* "GatewayDiagnosticLog"
* "IKEDiagnosticLog"
* "P2SDiagnosticLog”
* "TunnelDiagnosticLog"
* "RouteDiagnosticLog"

In order to execute the query, you have to open the Log Analytics resource you configured to receive the diagnostic logs, and then select **Logs** under the **General** tab on the left side of the pane:

:::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-virtual-wan/log-analytics-query-samples.png" alt-text="Log Analytics Query Samples.":::

For additional Log Analytics query samples for Azure VPN Gateway, both Site-to-Site and Point-to-Site, you can visit the page [Troubleshoot Azure VPN Gateway using diagnostic logs](../vpn-gateway/troubleshoot-vpn-with-azure-diagnostics.md). 
For Azure Firewall, a [workbook](../firewall/firewall-workbook.md) is provided to make log analysis easier. Using its graphical interface, it will be possible to investigate into the diagnostic data without manually writing any Log Analytics query. 

## <a name="activity-logs"></a>Activity logs

**Activity log** entries are collected by default and can be viewed in the Azure portal. You can use Azure activity logs (formerly known as *operational logs* and *audit logs*) to view all operations submitted to your Azure subscription.

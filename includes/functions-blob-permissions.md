You will need to create a role assignment that provides access to your blob container at runtime. Management roles like [Owner](../articles/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#owner) are not sufficient. The following table shows built-in roles that are recommended when using the Blob Storage extension in normal operation. Your application may require additional permissions based on the code you write.

| Binding type   | Example built-in roles                |
|----------------|---------------------------------------|
| Trigger        | [Storage Blob Data Owner] **and** [Storage Queue Data Contributor]<sup>1</sup> |
| Input binding  | [Storage Blob Data Reader]            |
| Output binding | [Storage Blob Data Owner]             |

<sup>1</sup> By default, the blob trigger uses Azure Queues internally. It therefore also requires [Storage Queue Data Contributor] permissions to create and receive messages.

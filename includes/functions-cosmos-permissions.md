You will need to create a role assignment that provides access to your database account at runtime. Management roles like [Owner](../articles/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#owner) are not sufficient. The following table shows built-in roles that are recommended when using the Cosmos DB extension in normal operation. Your application may require additional permissions based on the code you write.

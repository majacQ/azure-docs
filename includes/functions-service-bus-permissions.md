You will need to create a role assignment that provides access to your topics and queues at runtime. The scope of the role assignment must be for a Service Bus namespace, not limited to a specific queue or topic. Management roles like [Owner](../articles/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#owner) are not sufficient. The following table shows built-in roles that are recommended when using the Service Bus extension in normal operation. Your application may require additional permissions based on the code you write.

| Binding type   | Example built-in roles                                            |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Trigger        | [Azure Service Bus Data Receiver], [Azure Service Bus Data Owner] |
| Output binding | [Azure Service Bus Data Sender]                                   |

[Azure Service Bus Data Sender]: ../articles/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#azure-service-bus-data-sender

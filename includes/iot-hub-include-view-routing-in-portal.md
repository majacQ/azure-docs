Now that your endpoints and message routes are set up, you can view their configuration in the portal. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and go to **Resource Groups**. Next, select your resource group, then select your hub  (the hub name starts with `ContosoTestHub` in this tutorial). You see the IoT Hub pane.

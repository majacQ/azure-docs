Anyone who has access to your workspace can label data in your project.  You can also customize the permissions for labelers so that they can access labeling but not other parts of the workspace or your labeling project.  For more information, see [Manage access to an Azure Machine Learning workspace](../articles/machine-learning/how-to-assign-roles.md), and learn how to create the [labeler custom role](../articles/machine-learning/how-to-assign-roles.md#labeler).

After the labeling project is initialized, some aspects of the  project are immutable. You can't change the task type or dataset. You *can* modify labels and the URL for the task description. Carefully review the settings before you create the project. After you submit the project, you're returned to the **Data Labeling** homepage, which will show the project as **Initializing**.

> [!NOTE]
> This page may not automatically refresh. So, after a pause,  manually refresh the page to see the project's status as **Created**.

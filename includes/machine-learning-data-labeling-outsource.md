Select **Use a vendor labeling company from Azure Marketplace** only if you've engaged a data labeling company from [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/consulting-services?page=1&search=AzureMLVend). Then select the vendor.  If your vendor doesn't appear in the list, unselect this option.

Make sure you first contact the vendor and sign a contract.  For more information, see [Work with a data labeling vendor company (preview)](../articles/machine-learning/how-to-outsource-data-labeling.md).

Select **Next** to continue.

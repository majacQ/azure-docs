Labeling projects are administered from Azure Machine Learning. You use the **Data Labeling** page to manage your projects.

If your data is already in Azure Blob storage, you should make it available as a datastore before you create the labeling project. For an example of using a datastore, see [Tutorial: Create your first image classification labeling project](../articles/machine-learning/tutorial-labeling.md).
